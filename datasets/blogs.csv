1,"One of the most helpful things in my own recovery journey has been hearing about other people’s experiences with OCD. This might be because we relish in stories of triumph and are drawn toward people with shared experiences. I think this is true for many things in life. Personally, I learn and grow from these stories.",p,,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,56,5
2,"There is something powerful about knowing that someone else has walked the same path as you and that they have not only survived it, but possibly even thrived. I love hearing about the determination and grit of others who have faced similar obstacles. These stories of hope often inspired me to keep going, even when I didn’t think I could. ",p,,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,60,4
3,"Support is a key piece of your recovery journey. That’s why at NOCD, we provide a safe space for people in the OCD community and their families to share their experiences in our virtual support groups, which are available to members doing exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy with NOCD Therapy. There are over 25 different groups to join, with sessions nearly every day of the week, dealing with themes ranging from living with OCD to relapse prevention.",p,,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,78,4

5,"Support groups may help you realize that you are not alone. Many people have struggled with OCD for so long without proper treatment, going from therapist to therapist in hopes of finding relief, unable to get the specialized treatment needed to manage OCD. It’s often by hearing about other people’s experiences with successful treatment that they are able to learn about ERP therapy and finally get the help they need. And during treatment, support from others can help people keep going when things get challenging.  ",p,You are not alone,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,85,5
6,"This is one of the main reasons I continue to share my story: I want others to know that life can look very different from what it does in the throes of OCD. It may not seem like it at the moment, but there is hope after OCD—and you can live a life you may never have imagined. Similarly, support groups can provide a non-judgmental place where you can learn from others and healthily express your emotions.",p,You are not alone,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,77,4
7,"These support systems can normalize your experiences and reduce the shame and guilt often experienced by people with OCD and other mental illnesses. You can lean on others for their support and backing, and they can provide encouragement and help you recognize improvements that you may not realize you’ve made. This can provide a sense of control over your life, as you get to decide how to share your story. ",p,You are not alone,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,70,4

9,"Participating in a support group may seem scary at first; after all, you may be sharing your struggles and thoughts with others. However, vulnerability in sharing your experiences can often have a tremendous impact on your life and in the lives of others. For example, sharing my story helps others see a glimpse into what recovery can look like and provide hope; but in turn, I can also look back at my journey and am reminded daily of how far I’ve come. This helps to me stay on track—I know the things that I need to do to stay healthy and to remain in recovery with my OCD. ",p,Giving and getting support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,108,5
10,"Sharing keeps me accountable and reminds me of the powerful tools I have learned and the importance of using them on a daily basis. I have found that being vulnerable also helps with the shame aspect of OCD: when I share my personal struggle and give it a voice, it takes the shameful feelings away each time, bit by bit. That’s because when you talk about something out loud, it can take away its power. Since you are choosing to share, you are in essence choosing freedom over fear.",p,Giving and getting support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,89,5
11,"Additionally, developing a sense of purpose from your own painful experiences may even inspire others. You may be the very person who helps someone realize that they too can get better and live in recovery. They may regain confidence in treatment and in themselves. ",p,Giving and getting support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,44,4
12,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",h2,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,4,1
13,"You will likely also find that support groups provide a place for accountability in addition to your therapist. Having a therapist trained in ERP and who specializes in OCD cannot be replaced—the knowledge and expertise they have is unmatched, and the skills and the work that they help you do in treatment is unique. They help you build the foundation for the work that you will continue to do throughout your life, for as long as you experience symptoms of OCD. ",p,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,81,4
14,"But when people are in ERP, they often need to have people they trust who can hold them accountable for their treatment. This is true in most areas of our lives. Think about the idea behind playing a sport, for example. A coach is there to support you, to check in, to look for progress, and keep you accountable to ensure you are doing the best work you can. Your team also motivates you and can also help to keep you accountable, as they are in (or were in) your same shoes. It makes sense then that having a group of people who are experiencing similar things as yourself can be so beneficial. There is something powerful about being in a room full of people (even a virtual room) who “get it,” and who have lived experiences that you can relate to. That is what a good OCD support group will do: it allows for accountability and support.",p,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,158,9
15,"In addition to accountability, support groups can help you find more resources and connect you with other sources of support. You can learn to become your own advocate and provide advocacy for others. You can gain insight into what relapse prevention looks like.",p,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,43,4
16,Support groups are also a great tool to help manage and reduce stress. Just talking about the things that make you feel isolated and hidden can be cathartic in and of itself. Having a safe place to be your authentic self and meet others who have similar experiences is a wonderful confidence booster. ,p,"Accountability, advocacy, and authenticity",/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,53,4

18,"Finding support in a community of others with OCD can be an integral part of the recovery process. It can provide an outlet to express yourself with others who will be understanding and empathetic. However, it’s important to remember that even with the support of others, ERP therapy with a licensed and trained OCD specialist is needed to treat and manage the disorder.  ",p,ERP alongside support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,63,4
19,"ERP is the gold standard treatment for OCD. This form of therapy involves specifically targeting the source of your obsessions by directly exposing you to it. In many cases, people find that ERP helps their anxiety subside to the point where they no longer experience intense fears related to their thoughts on a regular basis. ",p,ERP alongside support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,55,4
20,"ERP therapy is an active form of treatment and requires intentional buy-in when participating in exposures, a willingness to feel discomfort, and honesty with your therapist about your obsessions and compulsions (even if they are shameful or taboo). ERP therapy has been proven to effectively treat people with OCD. Remember that you are not your OCD, and getting better is possible. ",p,ERP alongside support,/blog/nocd-support-groups-finding-help-and-hope-in-the-ocd-community,61,4

24,Why I Stopped Calling OCD Thoughts “Bad”,h1,title,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,7,1
25,"I remember the first time I called a thought “bad.” I was 6 years old, and at that moment I felt like the worst child in the world. I felt unlovable and unworthy. I was full of shame and guilt. I believed that my thoughts were evil and represented who I was at my core, my very character. ",p,,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,58,6
26,"As a child with a developing brain, it would have been impossible to see that this was not indicative of my true character. I remember vividly describing the thoughts to my mom as “bad” thoughts, or as nightmares that happened while I was awake. My mom cleverly started referring to them as “daymares.”",p,,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,53,4
27,"Looking back on this, my mom and I gave these thoughts way more attention and power than we should have. This was a time period before the internet (can you imagine?), when we didn’t have information about this disorder at our fingertips. I spent years calling these thoughts “bad,” not realizing the damage that this would cause to my sense of self and my belief system.",p,,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,66,4

29,"The truth is that thoughts are neither good nor bad: they just “are.” They are neutral. They are meaningless until you give them meaning – in other words, it is you who give your thoughts meaning, and this is what can cause distress.  ",p,The truth about our thoughts,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,43,4
30,"If I wrote something down on paper does that make it true? What if I am at a grocery store and all of the sudden I decide to yell “fire” at the top of my lungs? Does that mean there is a fire? Maybe I even tell everyone I started that fire, when there clearly is no fire. How is this different from thinking about it? ",p,The truth about our thoughts,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,66,2
31,"The same is true no matter what the thoughts involve, whether it is harming a loved one or doing an illegal act. Yet, we tend to give so much weight to our thoughts. This is especially true when we have OCD. ",p,The truth about our thoughts,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,41,4
32,"Discomfort, in and of itself, doesn’t equal “bad.” Anxiety doesn’t equal “bad.”  We may not like how it makes us feel, and we may prefer not to feel it. But when we label things as “bad,” particularly our own thoughts, we start to see ourselves in this light and incorporate certain beliefs about ourselves, our values, or our identity.",p,The truth about our thoughts,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,59,5
33,"When we have OCD, we doubt the very core of who we are. We doubt that these thoughts don’t have a deeper meaning or mean something sinister. We question whether we are secretly “bad” people who want to do the things that pop into our heads. This can be a terrifying way to live. It is not until we flip the script and refuse to characterize a thought as good or bad that we can find freedom from this debilitating disorder. ",p,The truth about our thoughts,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,81,6
34,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,h2,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,7,1
35,"For so many years, I had developed a poor sense of self due to my own intrusive thoughts. It made me feel negatively about who I was as a person. I had difficulty forming friendships and struggled in my relationships. The way I felt about myself trickled into every area of my life. I always thought people were mad at me or that they didn’t like me. I could turn even the most neutral comment from someone into a confirmation that they hated me. It felt so real, and I never questioned it. ",p,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,93,8
36,"That’s what OCD does. It sneaks in and makes you believe that the thoughts that you have about yourself are real: that you are the monster it tells you that you are, or that your worst fear will come true. For me, it would take years to challenge this and to see it for what it was. ",p,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,57,4
37,A pretty stable fear of mine was having a life-threatening reaction to medication.

38,"There was the time I told myself that my third childbirth would be different, and that I would not let fear stop me from having pain management medications as it did with my first two children. I knew this would likely ruffle OCD’s feathers. I received a spinal block and instantly I began to panic: it felt like my world was spinning, my throat closing in. I truly believed that I was in anaphylactic shock – but I was not. ",p,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,80,5
39,"There was the time I was having a standard outpatient mole removal procedure and was given a numbing shot. I immediately told the nurse and doctor my throat was closing and I was dying – but I was not. Another time I had to get my tooth pulled and warned my dentist that the shot I needed for the procedure would cause me to “freak out.” He was so confident and said it would all be fine. As soon as the shot hit, I told him my throat was closing in and I needed help. Not true – I was just fine, only slightly embarrassed. ",p,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,105,7
40,"Then it happened, I was having a surgical procedure. At this point in my journey, I was several years into treatment for OCD and feeling capable of taking on any fears. After all, I had faced several fears already and made it through them, so what could go wrong? Turns out I actually was allergic to a medication they gave me and had a reaction. ",p,My thoughts shaped my sense of self,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,65,4

42,"As you can see from my own examples, OCD makes it hard to let go of the thoughts – but not impossible. It is a skill I had to practice over and over.

44,"ERP allows you to retrain your brain to know that there is no real danger at the moment. Using ERP, I repeatedly allowed myself to sit with the discomfort and anxiety that each thought brought without trying to rid myself of those feelings. Gradually, I was able to see that the thoughts I had did not come true, and in the extremely rare incidents that something difficult happened, I was able to handle it. I survived it.",p,Learning that thoughts are neither “good” nor “bad” – and how to sit with them,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,77,5
45,"Getting treatment also helped me recognize more readily that everyone – whether they have OCD or not – has these same thoughts, they just don’t necessarily get stuck on them. Instead, they can often more easily shift unwanted thoughts from their brain, without even paying attention to them. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t envious of that ability.

46,"I also wish I could say that I perfectly follow ERP everyday and never struggle with OCD, anxiety and intrusive thoughts. But I would be remiss in telling anyone that. I do still struggle, but far less than before I knew how to respond effectively. The important thing is that I get it right about 80 percent of the time, and that is okay with me. I am in recovery, I still have OCD, but it is manageable. ",p,Learning that thoughts are neither “good” nor “bad” – and how to sit with them,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,78,6
47,"Today I am careful to not refer to the thoughts that I get stuck on as “bad” thoughts; instead, I just say they are thoughts, and they are neither good nor bad. They just exist. I no longer have “bad” thoughts. I have thoughts, like everyone else, and sometimes they get a little “stuck.” I know how to handle it. The wonderful thing is that the more I respond differently, the less the thoughts are there, and the less they bother me. ",p,Learning that thoughts are neither “good” nor “bad” – and how to sit with them,/blog/why-i-stopped-calling-ocd-thoughts-bad,82,7

Your need for reassurance could stem from general self-esteem issues or a history of toxic relationships.

It got more extreme over time, telling me that I couldn’t  do certain things without some type of dire consequence. I was afraid to step on cracks in the ground.

79,"If you are going through OCD treatment right now using exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, then you are likely familiar with the term habituation. Habituation refers to a natural process that often occurs where repeated and prolonged exposure to a feared situation leads to reduced fear responding. Put simply, the more we face our fears, the easier it gets.",p,,/blog/what-if-my-anxiety-is-not-decreasing-during-erp,60,4
80,"You might not realize it, but you have almost certainly experienced habituation at some point in your life. Most of us have had natural childhood fears of things that initially seemed scary, like pedaling a bicycle without training wheels, watching a horror film, or swimming in the deep end of a swimming pool without a floatation device. As most kids do, we overcame those fears by facing them (i.e., putting ourselves in the situation repeatedly), which likely led to a progressive reduction and eventual elimination of any anxiety we experienced. ",p,,/blog/what-if-my-anxiety-is-not-decreasing-during-erp,90,6
81,"For decades, ERP experts have emphasized the importance of habituation in overcoming OCD and other related anxiety conditions. People receiving ERP are frequently instructed to (1) remain in the feared situation until their anxiety level has reduced significantly, often by 50%, and (2) continue to repeatedly practice the same ERP exercises until their anxiety level has diminished to a minimal amount or has gone away completely. These time-honored instructions have helped countless individuals make gains and overcome OCD for decades.",p,,/blog/what-if-my-anxiety-is-not-decreasing-during-erp,80,4
82,"However, if we only focus on habituation during ERP, we might encounter problems. First, while most people experience habituation during and between ERP exercises, some do not—and that’s ok. Additionally, focusing exclusively on habituation may unintentionally send the wrong message that anxiety is an unacceptable feeling that we must get rid of, which is not necessarily true. The reality is that we need to feel anxious in certain situations that are objectively dangerous in order to keep ourselves safe. If you began to cross a busy street without checking for traffic, it would of course be a good thing to be anxious, as your anxiety would cue you to engage in reasonably safe behavior (e.g., checking for traffic). Finally, if our focus during ERP is strictly on habituation, we may lose out on other factors that have been shown to be important in facilitating a positive treatment outcome.",p,,/blog/what-if-my-anxiety-is-not-decreasing-during-erp,148,9

84,"Although reducing fear and anxiety—habituation—is an important area of focus in ERP, it should not be the only focus. There are other factors that come into play in ERP that are associated with a positive therapeutic outcome. If you feel you are too narrowly focused on habituation in your ERP work, consider speaking with your therapist and mentioning some of the other variables in this article that can be helpful to pay attention to when you’re doing ERP.",p,What are other important things to pay attention to during your ERP work beyond habituation? ,/blog/what-if-my-anxiety-is-not-decreasing-during-erp,78,4

88,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder where you have recurring intrusive thoughts that create a sensation of deep discomfort and lead to compulsions. Everybody experiences intrusive, unwanted thoughts during their lives, but if you have this condition, you tend to feel completely overwhelmed by these thoughts and react to them with repetitive behaviors or mental acts. According to the official medical definition, the obsessions and/or compulsions take up at least one hour per day and are so inhibiting they may interfere with your well-being and become all-consuming. You can find a full breakdown of the different elements that make up OCD in our article here.",p,What is OCD?,/blog/two-different-kinds-of-ocd,105,5
89,"OCD is often misrepresented as something that simply makes you into a very tidy or very clean person, or somebody who is very specific about certain rituals. However, the OCD spectrum is wide and varied, and there is no simple one-size-fits-all approach to it. It’s a disorder that tends to change so much from person to person that specialists categorize it as a “heterogeneous” disorder.

But the way these symptoms manifest, such as the types of things your mind focuses on or the compulsive behaviors that result from it, can be very different from person to person. One individual can have intrusive thoughts about germs and engage in six hours per day of hand-washing. Another can have intrusive thoughts about harming others and engage in three hours of checking/reassurance seeking. ",p,What are the different types of OCD?,/blog/two-different-kinds-of-ocd,90,6

Some specialists might call them symptom dimensions. It could be helpful for you to be able to identify yourself with a category and to learn that some people feel very similar to how you do, but it isn’t particularly helpful to worry too much about what category you are in if you don’t feel like it’s clean-cut.",p,What are the different types of OCD?,/blog/two-different-kinds-of-ocd,105,4

100,"When I am working with members who have OCD, there are two words that are often at the forefront of their minds: guilt and shame. Guilt is the feeling you have when you perceive you have done something wrong. Shame is when you internalize that you are a “bad” person. It is important to recognize how these two emotions relate and how they are different. Shame may be focused on who you are as a human being, while guilt may focus more on actions you may or may not have done. ",p,,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,91,6

102,"When people with OCD experience thoughts, feelings, or urges that they consider taboo, disturbing, or frightening, it often leads to feelings of intense guilt and shame. It has been suggested that people with OCD experience “guilt sensitivity,” meaning they have a higher aversion to feelings of guilt—much like they do with distress and anxiety. They may feel like they cannot tolerate it. ",p,Why it’s difficult for people with OCD to tolerate guilt and shame ,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,62,4
103,"Meanwhile, shame can make them feel like something is wrong with them on a core level.

105,"We know that people without OCD also find feelings such as guilt, shame, anxiety, and distress to be uncomfortable feelings, but those without OCD may have more confidence in their ability to cope with these feelings. If your core beliefs about yourself are rooted in shame and guilt—which is the case for many people with OCD—then it can be very difficult to have confidence in yourself and your ability to manage OCD. That’s one reason that feelings of shame and guilt can interfere with treatment and recovery. ",p,Why it’s difficult for people with OCD to tolerate guilt and shame ,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,87,4

108,"One of the first things that I tell my members when I meet them is that nothing they tell me will shock or surprise me, and it certainly won’t cause me to make any negative judgment about them. I truly mean this: therapists who are trained in OCD know that the thoughts, feelings, images, and urges someone has are not indicative of who they are and reveal nothing of their true desires.

110,One of my favorite exposure and response prevention (ERP) that I encourage my members to do involves nothing more than saying the thoughts or feelings that bring them shame or guilt. I ask them to write down an imaginary script of their worst-case scenario or of their most taboo or uncomfortable thoughts (they may just write down triggering words initially). Then I tell them that they’ll be reading and recording their script. ,p,Sharing thoughts out loud can take away their power,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,72,4
111,"Prior to recording it, I ask them to read what they have written out loud and then tell me what level of anxiety they experienced while reading it, on a scale from 1-10 (10 being the highest level of anxiety they have ever felt). Afterwards, I ask them to listen to it over and over again while resisting the urge to do any compulsions in response, whether physical or mental. They are asked to sit with any discomfort or anxiety they experience while listening to it, in order to allow these feelings to pass on their own. Once they complete the exercise, I ask them to rank their anxiety again. ",p,Sharing thoughts out loud can take away their power,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,110,5

Members often tell me that there was just something different about hearing their own voice saying the things that cause them such pain and torment. But, within a week of assigning this activity, the majority of people will come back and report substantially less anxiety and discomfort from hearing these thoughts or feelings. They will also say that a side effect of listening to it seems to be that their brain recognizes even more so how illogical the scenarios they fear are. ",p,Sharing thoughts out loud can take away their power,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,98,5

114,"Though the goal of ERP is to allow anxiety to be present in order to learn that we do not need to engage in compulsions, often the impact of the intrusive thoughts themselves reduces as well. Not only does ERP help someone learn to tolerate discomfort, but it also reduces the discomfort that comes from their obsessions. By separating who they are from what they think and feel, they can more readily tolerate the distress caused by these thoughts, recognizing that they are not a reflection of who they are. ",p,Overcoming guilt and shame due to OCD ,/blog/how-to-deal-with-guilt-and-shame-from-ocd,90,4

164,What Is Hoarding OCD?,h1,title,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,4,1
165,"Hoarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype characterized by ongoing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors around acquiring possessions and having difficulty discarding them. People with hoarding OCD experience frequent intrusive thoughts around either acquiring/keeping possessions (e.g., “I need to have this item. I won’t be able to handle my emotions if I don’t get it”)  or throwing them away (e.g., “If I get rid of this shirt I got as a birthday gift, something terrible might happen to the person who gave it to me”). ",p,,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,86,8
166,"Hoarding OCD is separate from hoarding disorder. Even though hoarding disorder was once considered part of OCD, it is now its own diagnosis. What distinguishes hoarding disorder from hoarding OCD is the reason why someone is hoarding. Individuals with hoarding disorder accumulate items because they think they are valuable, while OCD-related hoarding is generally an unwanted response to an obsessive thought and anxiety. People with hoarding OCD typically experience their accumulation of possessions stressful and unwanted. They may feel something bad will happen if they discard a particular item. Conversely, people with hoarding disorder find value in the possessions and want to keep them, and they experience distress when they are forced to discard them because they don’t want to sacrifice an item they perceive as holding value.",p,,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,128,8
167,"Hoarding OCD often revolves around items that feel central to a person’s identity. This could include personal letters, past greeting cards, invitations, souvenirs, etc. A person with hoarding OCD may fear a loss of a central part of their identity if they discard a specific item. Hoarding OCD might also include certain purchasing rituals or making sure a person has a certain number of an item in their home. For example, they may feel that they can only purchase soda in multiples of two or something bad will happen. They may develop compulsions around discarding specific items (e.g., meticulously sorting recyclables from trash and compulsively checking to ensure the sorting was done properly).",p,,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,113,9
168,"Often, people with hoarding OCD are motivated by fears of contamination. For example, someone might not want to throw away their trash for fear of having to touch the doorknob to the trash room that they believe may be contaminated. Or someone might avoid donating their books or clothes because they are worried their clothes will contaminate others’ belongings. Someone with hoarding OCD may also purchase all the items they touched in a store for fear of potentially contaminating other shoppers. ",,,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,81,5

172,"The best course of treatment for hoarding OCD, like all types of OCD, is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. The idea behind ERP is that repeated exposure to obsessive thoughts without engaging in compulsions is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually reach out for the compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. ",p,Hoarding OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,91,5
173,"ERP is considered the gold standard for OCD treatment and has been found to be 80% effective. The majority of patients experience results within 12-20 sessions. As part of ERP therapy, you will track your obsessions and compulsions around hoarding and make a list of how distressing each thought is. You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions. This could include going to a store or donating clothes, depending on the cause of the patient’s obsessions. This has to be carefully planned to ensure it’s effective and so that you’re gradually building toward your goal rather than moving too quickly and getting completely overwhelmed.",p,Hoarding OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,112,7

175,"Let’s say you struggle with hoarding OCD and feel that you must buy apples in multiples of six or something bad will happen. With a therapist, you’ll work toward overcoming this compulsion, with the goal of being able to buy any number of apples. A therapist may ask you to buy only one apple as an exposure. At first, you might think, “There’s no way I can do that. I can only buy six apples at a time or something bad will happen.” If an exposure feels too overwhelming to start with, you’ll work with the therapist to find the right intensity for you. ",p,Examples of OCD ERP exposures ,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,104,7
176,"You might start by becoming more comfortable with your intrusive thoughts that arise when you start thinking about breaking your ritual. In ERP therapy, this often involves facing your fears and discussing the worst-case scenario you are trying to prevent with the apple buying ritual. So your therapist might ask you to think about, “What would happen if you only buy one apple instead of six?” followed by, “If something bad does happen as a result, what would that mean?” This process helps familiarize you with the uncertainty causing the anxiety that is driving your compulsive behaviors. When you can discuss these fears, they begin to feel more manageable. ",,Examples of OCD ERP exposures ,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,109,5
177,"Once you choose a plan, you’ll work with your therapist on the emotions that come up during the exposures. It will be scary at first. It may bring up many of the fears you’ve been trying to alleviate with your compulsions (e.g., what if my therapist is wrong, and nothing bad has happened yet because I’ve never broken my ritual?). But with practice, you’ll find the intense need to engage in your compulsion will wane. You will get to a point where the anxiety subsides, and you are able to purchase the number of apples you actually want. ",p,Examples of OCD ERP exposures ,/blog/what-is-hoarding-ocd,98,8

183,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most debilitating conditions and prevalent conditions in the world, affecting more than 2.3% of the population in their lifetime. As a chronic condition, OCD is characterized by intrusive, distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing that distress. With OCD, a person’s compulsions only temporarily relieve discomfort and actually makes their distress worse in the long run. As such, OCD typically significantly affects a person’s quality of life—but OCD is also highly treatable and manageable with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy.",p,,/blog/could-virtual-erp-be-the-new-standard-of-treatment-for-ocd,89,6
184,"As a gold standard OCD treatment, ERP is an evidence-based, specialized therapy that has consistently demonstrated excellent outcomes in the treatment of OCD. ERP works by having people purposely face situations that provoke their obsessions, then helps them resist doing compulsions in response to the resulting distress.",p,,/blog/could-virtual-erp-be-the-new-standard-of-treatment-for-ocd,47,3
185,"As people habituate to the distress brought on by their obsessions and reduce their reliance on compulsions, they spend less time and energy avoiding distress.

186,"Despite the extensive evidence of the efficacy of ERP from clinical studies and in real-world samples, it’s still an underused treatment. The reasons have historically been related to limitations in the access to care for the majority of individuals with OCD and related conditions, including the scarcity of adequately trained ERP therapists, the lack of geographical locations with OCD specialists, and time and cost barriers. ",p,,/blog/could-virtual-erp-be-the-new-standard-of-treatment-for-ocd,65,3

This is because virtual treatment overcomes a major barrier that many people with OCD have to start, and follow through with, therapy, since in-person treatment is not widely available in most geographic areas. Another important reason is because therapists can more easily help their members manage their fears in the environment where they are most bothered, as opposed to in an office, where it may not generalize to real-world settings.

224,"Religious or scrupulosity obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype characterized by ongoing intrusive thoughts, images or urges, as well as compulsive behaviors or mental actions around violating a religious, moral or ethical belief. People with religious or scrupulosity OCD experience frequent worry and guilt about violating a religious or ethical code and what it means about them as a person (e.g., “Did I allow myself to have an “impure” thought in church? Does it mean that I’m a sinner and must repent?”). The guilt and anxiety drive these people to engage in various compulsions aimed to alleviate their distress (e.g., confessing to a religious figure). ",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-ocd,106,8

Today, mental health professionals also use the term to describe OCD thoughts related to ethics and morality in a secular context. ",,Religious or Scrupulosity OCD Symptoms,/blog/scrupulosity-ocd,46,3
227,"Many religious people may be concerned they have sinned and want reassurance. However, with religious or scrupulosity OCD, the concern is never-ending, and these doubting thoughts can feel impossible to let go of despite extensive reassurance. Someone with this condition may have a thought come into their mind about eating a meal on a day when they are fasting. They might begin thinking: “Is it okay I thought about food right now? Am I fasting correctly? Have I sinned? Will I not have access to the afterlife?” ",p,Religious or Scrupulosity OCD Symptoms,/blog/scrupulosity-ocd,87,4
228,"This unrelenting anxiety and fear about committing a sin may cause a person to confess to their religious leader. But confirmation they haven’t sinned may only ease the anxiety temporarily. It’s a matter of time before the thoughts kick back in, and they begin to think: “I didn’t share how I wished I could break the fast when I saw a family barbecue at the beach. Maybe I should go back and confess this as well.” Regardless of the confirmation, the person’s OCD will come up with more and more fuel for their doubting thoughts. ",p,Religious or Scrupulosity OCD Symptoms,/blog/scrupulosity-ocd,95,6

247,"Pedophilia OCD (P-OCD) is a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) characterized by obsessive thoughts, images, and impulses and compulsive behaviors around unwanted sexual thoughts about children. A person with P-OCD may be obsessively concerned with proving to themselves they are not a pedophile. For someone with P-OCD, the idea of potentially harming a child is terrifying, and this fear causes them to engage in compulsive behavior aimed at alleviating this fear (e.g., excessive online research about what makes someone a pedophile).",p,,/blog/your-complete-guide-to-pedophilia-ocd-pocd,81,6
248,"OCD tends to fixate on what is most important to the individual, and when children’s well-being and safety is one of a person’s core values, OCD will often latch on and cause a person to have obsessions and compulsions centered around this value. The fact that the obsession is centered on something so important to the individual makes the doubting thoughts all the more anxiety-provoking (e.g., “How can I be absolutely sure I won’t hurt a child?”). ",,,/blog/your-complete-guide-to-pedophilia-ocd-pocd,77,5

They are either excessively afraid of acting like a pedophile (“What if I accidently touch this child in an inappropriate way when I’m alone with them?”) or they are concerned that their thoughts will make them a pedophile (“I can’t believe I found a teenager attractive. It must mean I’m a pedophile.”) For people with P-OCD, these concerns and fears feel impossible to let go of.

While a pedophile takes pleasure in their sexual thoughts about children, someone with P-OCD is horrified by them and will spend a huge amount of energy trying to make these thoughts go away.

Shouldn’t you be with someone with better taste? These obsessive thoughts won’t stop, so to ease yourself of the anxiety and doubt, you call a friend to ask if they think your relationship is working and what they think about your partner’s taste in music.

Someone with ROCD might spend hours thinking about whether they are with the right person. Other compulsions often take the form of checking and mental review. You might be engaged in what feels like endless mental tests to make sure you love your partner. You might replay questions like: Are they attractive enough? Do they have the right eye color?

303,"Relationships can be challenging for most people, but if you or someone you love struggles with relationship OCD, you know that it’s a completely different type of challenge to face. Relationship OCD, sometimes referred to as ROCD, is a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that causes cyclical thoughts and compulsions around one’s relationship. If you’ve realized you or your partner are experiencing relationship OCD, it can be hard to know where to begin. The good news is that there are solutions for managing relationship OCD and gaining more control over the compulsions it can bring on. ",p,,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,96,5

For a person with ROCD, any detail they consider imperfect or uncertain in the relationship could potentially launch these cycles. ",p,What is relationship OCD? ,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,50,4
312,"While we all struggle with intrusive thoughts or fleeting concerns here and there, especially in intimate relationships, it’s consistently returning thoughts — or a repeating cycle of them — that can be a sign of OCD, or in this case, ROCD. If you suspect you or your partner might be dealing with ROCD, it may be time to reach out to a licensed therapist with experience treating OCD. ",p,What is relationship OCD? ,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,68,3

314,"Because ROCD is a subtype of OCD, it’s highly treatable with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. ERP is the gold standard of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for OCD. The treatment works by exposing those with OCD to potentialtriggers in a safe and controlled environment. It’s incredibly important to find a therapist who specializes in ERP so they can lead you through confronting your compulsive responses to triggers and decrease those responses over time. While the process may feel a little uncomfortable at first, eventually it can help to free those with OCD from the constraints of their compulsions.",p,What’s the best therapy for ROCD? ,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,99,6
315,"With ROCD specifically, exposure and response prevention focuses on showing people that they can tolerate the intrusive thoughts that arise around their relationship without needing to act on those thoughts. For example, they can have the thought “maybe I’m not with the right person” without engaging in reassurance seeking or other compulsions. Those with ROCD are then able to gain further insight and learn that they don’t need to do anything about intrusive thoughts nor let them determine the relationship’s trajectory.  ",p,What’s the best therapy for ROCD? ,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,81,4

317,"In some relationships, the partner without ROCD might actually be inadvertently enabling the symptoms or compulsions of the partner with ROCD — often through things like reassuring their partner about their feelings or connection — which could be unintentionally hindering progress. That’s why clinics like the University of North Carolina’s Anxiety and Stress Disorders Clinic have developed and begun testing the effects of CBT treatment conducted as couples-based therapy. In this method, the couple learns to navigate ROCD symptoms together so that one partner doesn’t unintentionally reinforce the other’s OCD symptoms.",p,Should you involve your partner in your ROCD therapy? ,/blog/best-therapy-for-relationship-ocd-erp,91,4

342,Is Hoarding a Sign of OCD? Here’s What the Behavior Most Likely Means,h1,title,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,13,1
343,"When thinking about obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), hoarding might be the last thing that comes to mind. OCD and hoarding disorder may seem like complete opposites. OCD often conjures up images of immaculately clean and neat spaces while hoarding disorder most likely brings about images of rooms overrun with dirt and clutter. However seemingly different these disorders might appear on the surface, they actually both fall under the obsessive compulsive and related disorders category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). Additionally, while not always the case, hoarding behaviors can be indicative of a possible OCD diagnosis. Given how closely related hoarding disorder and certain presentations of OCD can be, it is important to understand what exactly hoarding disorder is, how it can be distinguished from OCD, and when hoarding behavior may point to an OCD diagnosis.  ",p,,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,141,7
344,What is hoarding disorder? ,h2,What is hoarding disorder? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,4,1
345,"Similar to OCD, hoarding is an often misconstrued disorder and one which is frequently thrown about in conversation to describe friends who are messy or have cluttered homes. For many, their conception of what an individual with hoarding disorder may look like or act like comes from reality television. While the accumulation of clutter in different living areas in one’s home is almost always a feature of hoarding disorder, this alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis. For the accumulation of clutter to be a potential red flag for hoarding disorder, the clutter must reach a point of causing living spaces to lose some capacity to fully serve the rooms intended purpose. In other words, hoarding disorder may lead to a living room that cannot be lived in, a bedroom that cannot be slept in, or a kitchen that cannot be cooked in. ",p,What is hoarding disorder? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,143,6
346,"Not every individual with hoarding disorder lives in spaces overrun with clutter such as those described above. However, it is often  the case that if an individual with hoarding disorder has managed to declutter their spaces, it was likely a result of intervention from family, friends, or professional services. This is important to note because these individuals are not “cured” nor are they struggling with the effects of hoarding disorder any less than an individual whose spaces have not been decluttered. ",p,What is hoarding disorder? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,81,4
347,"For individuals with hoarding disorder, there are two main causes for the accumulation of clutter: difficulty parting with possessions and excessive acquisition of items. Parting with possessions poses a challenge for individuals with hoarding disorder as the sense that these possessions must be held onto for one reason or another is often quite strong. Difficulty discarding any item, despite its value, is a key feature of this disorder. While there are many different reasons why individuals with hoarding disorder become so attached to possessions, a few of the main reasons include the perceived utility, aesthetic value, or sentimental attachment to the items. To those without hoarding disorder some of the commonly saved items, such as newspapers, bags, old mail or paperwork, may seem useless. However, because of the perceived value of these items, getting rid of them, or even thinking about getting rid of them, is often accompanied by intense feelings of distress for those with hoarding disorder. ",p,What is hoarding disorder? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,158,7
348,"In addition to the difficulty parting with possessions, it is also extremely common for individuals with hoarding disorder to engage in the excessive acquisition of items. According to the DSM-5, around 80% to 90% of individuals with this disorder also display behaviors of excessive acquisition in the form of continuous purchasing or holding onto items they received for free. In some instances, individuals with hoarding disorder may also engage in stealing items although this is far less common than excessive purchasing or collecting free items. ",p,What is hoarding disorder? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,85,4

350,"Based on the description above, hoarding disorder may not seem at all related to OCD. OCD is marked by intrusive thoughts, followed by compulsive acts aimed at easing the distress related to those thoughts. The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsions are not typical for an individual with hoarding disorder. Rather, the distress associated with hoarding disorder stems from the difficulty associated with discarding possessions along with the ongoing acquisition of items. So how are these disorders linked? ",p,Distinguishing hoarding disorder from OCD,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,78,5
351,"Hoarding behavior, which is fundamental in hoarding disorder, may also be present for an individual with OCD. What distinguishes the two disorders are why the individual is engaging in hoarding behaviors. Individuals with hoarding disorder accumulate items because of their perceived value while OCD related hoarding is generally an unwanted response to an obsessive feeling or thought. While individuals with hoarding disorder experience distress as a result of having to discard items, individuals with OCD experience distress as a result of the compulsive accumulation of items. ",p,Distinguishing hoarding disorder from OCD,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,86,5
352,"While OCD hoarding behaviors can manifest in many ways, the most common is hoarding due to feelings of incompleteness. In other words, an individual with OCD may fear losing part of their identity or sense of self if they do not document all life experiences. This can result in the accumulation of any and all items the individual feels are related to their life such as toys, paperwork, birthday cards, etcetera. Hoarding related OCD can also be caused by fear of contamination which is an extremely common fear for individuals with OCD. An individual may avoid throwing items out because doing so would require touching items they perceive to be contaminated. Fear of contamination may also result in excessive acquisition similar to that in hoarding disorder. The individual may believe that everything they touch becomes contaminated and they therefore must purchase everything that they come into contact with in order to prevent others from contamination.",p,Distinguishing hoarding disorder from OCD,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,155,8

According to the DSM-5, around 20% of those with hoarding disorder also meet the criteria for an OCD diagnosis. In fact, individuals with hoarding disorder may not view their hoarding behaviors as problematic and therefore may not report symptoms.

Exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP therapy) is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that is regarded as the gold standard for treating OCD. ERP is also viewed as a successful treatment option for hoarding disorder. ERP treatment, which relies on the principle of habituation, involves the individual slowly exposing themselves to their intrusive thoughts and obsessions while refraining from engaging in their normal compulsive behaviors to alleviate their distress. Over time and through repeated exposure habituation occurs, meaning that the previously feared thoughts begin to lose their power and the anxiety and distress related to those thoughts begins to weaken. ",p,Are hoarding disorder and OCD treatable? ,/blog/is-hoarding-a-sign-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,119,6

456,"There’s definitely a relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD and anxiety. Many people who experience an obsession, which is an intrusive thought or image or urge that pops into their head, get very anxious when that occurs, and as a way to almost ameliorate that anxiety, they do a compulsion — some kind of mental or behavioral act that will somehow neutralize the experience and allow them to feel better again. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,71,3
457,"Unfortunately, as OCD progresses, it takes longer and longer to do those compulsions, and that’s why people feel stuck for more and more in their life as OCD gets worse and worse. There are people who may have OCD without experiencing anxiety; instead, they may feel guilt or shame or disgust and really identify when the obsession occurs that those are the experiences or feelings that they’re having. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,68,3
458,"We can still do the same type of treatment for them, even though it’s not necessarily an anxiety-based [diagnosis] but more again, a basis in disgust or guilt or shame or some other kind of emotion that they find to be very uncomfortable or unwanted. It wouldn’t be enough just to manage the anxiety because we want to make sure that we’re targeting the obsessions and compulsions in OCD. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,69,3
459,"There are very good anxiety management skills that people can use, and there’s great therapy out there for a general anxiety disorder or something of that nature. But when we’re going for OCD, we specifically have to do something called exposure and response prevention therapy. And that is really going to target triggering people’s obsessions, purposely sitting with those uncomfortable thoughts or images or urges, but at the same point doing something we call response prevention, or the elimination of the typical compulsion or ritual that someone does once they experience the obsession. It is only by allowing people to realize that they don’t need to do the compulsion, and that they can still handle the discomfort that they’re feeling, that they learn that they can overcome their obsessive-compulsive disorder. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,130,5
460,"All anxiety disorders can be treated with exposure and response prevention therapy, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the targets for what we’re going to do exposure and response prevention for are going to be different based on the disorders. So for example, if you have a panic disorder, I might expose you to uncomfortable physical sensations, and have you not run to the emergency room if that’s what you typically do. Instead, I will have you sit with those uncomfortable situations and let them pass on their own and learn that you can handle them. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,96,5
461,"Similar with OCD, I may expose you to an intrusive thought image or urge, and instead of doing your compulsion, which, for instance might be checking the locks to make sure they’re locked so that no one breaks in the house, I might have you purposely go to bed without checking the locks and learning that you can handle doing that. ",p,,/blog/ocd-anxiety-how-are-they-related,61,2

In fact, it is one of the commonly listed “symptom dimensions” in the DSM-5, along with symmetry, forbidden/ taboo, and harm thoughts., It is estimated that at least four percent of the population experiences some form of OCD. While it’s difficult to say exactly how many people experience contamination OCD, we can deduce that it is likely a significant percentage of individuals with OCD. ",p,How common is contamination OCD?,/blog/what-contamination-ocd-how-common-is-it,89,6
471,"Oftentimes what people believe to be OCD doesn’t adequately depict the experiences of those with contamination OCD despite it being one of the more widely recognized subtypes.  For example, mainstream media often portrays individuals with contamination OCD as being highly neat and organized. They may be shown as being diligent in cleaning or living in a spotless home with no sign of dust, mess, or clutter.. However, a person with contamination OCD might engage in different compulsions or experience their OCD in ways not accurately represented by the media’s depictions. For example, a person might spend hours researching the expiration dates of food in their fridge, might leave garbage in their home due to fear of becoming contaminated while disposing of it,  or might engage in excessive research around contamination, bacteria, and how to prevent contamination. Since this isn’t what most people think of when they think about OCD, it might be hard to identify the condition. Likewise, aperson could spend hours performing mental rituals, such as keeping mental lists of what is clean and what is dirty which is not perceivable  from an outsider’s perspective.As described, a person with contamination OCD could be characterized as simply being overly anxious, neat and organized. However, these stereotypes are not accurate depictions of all of those who experience this distressing and impairing diagnosis and misunderstanding can prevent someone from seeking out proper treatment. ",p,How common is contamination OCD?,/blog/what-contamination-ocd-how-common-is-it,231,11

For example, exposure to a public restroom could cause an acute anxiety of germs, followed by compulsive ritualistic hand-washing. But the compulsive action doesn’t make the fear go away; it only alleviates it temporarily. The idea behind ERP is that in order to break the cycle, a patient has to expose themselves to the cause of the compulsive action (in this case, the public restroom) and then resist the urge to alleviate the fear with the compulsive action. This allows them to learn that they can tolerate the discomfort or anxiety.",p,Treatment options for contamination OCD,/blog/what-contamination-ocd-how-common-is-it,114,6

It creates space between the stimulus and our response to it, allowing us to tackle the challenge with increased awareness and calm.  As a parent, one of the best things we can do when our children are anxious is to remain calm and steady (I know – easier said than done).

You can take a few deep breaths (in for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold for four counts) and then return to what you are doing with a more grounded perspective.

At the time, I didn’t know it was OCD, because I thought OCD was just about wanting things symmetrical, wanting to clean all the time, or about things needing to be just right.

540,"Every person with OCD has a unique story. Some experience an onset of symptoms in childhood, while others develop OCD in college or later in adulthood. The journey to receiving a proper diagnosis also differs for most, but it’s often filled with misdiagnosis, confusion, and extreme distress. For instance, research suggests it takes people with OCD 14-17 years on average to receive a formal diagnosis and evidence-based treatment, which is unfathomable given OCD is considered by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 most disabling conditions, and it leads people to be 10 times more likely to die by suicide.",p,,/blog/nocds-research-demonstrates-that-erp-therapy-is-effective-for-all-ocd-subtypes,103,5
541,"One of the main causes of the OCD identification crisis is that the condition manifests in an infinite amount of subtypes, many appearing unique in nature, but all similarly rooted in obsessions and compulsions. It’s common for people with Contamination OCD to fear that they will acquire or spread a deadly illness, while folks suffering from Religious OCD might feel deeply concerned that they have unforgivably sinned and are not devout in their faith practices. What’s more is that people with Religious OCD might not have any concerns about contamination, and people with Contamination OCD may fully trust that their religious faith is in good standing. But then, their subtypes could even morph unpredictably—the person with Religious OCD later experiences Contamination OCD symptoms and vice-versa. In sum, OCD has a tendency to “shapeshift” over a long course of time.",p,,/blog/nocds-research-demonstrates-that-erp-therapy-is-effective-for-all-ocd-subtypes,139,6
542,"Although the nuances of each OCD subtype have historically made it challenging for providers to diagnose OCD properly, they have encouraged many people with OCD to build online communities around specific subtypes. These communities not only educate about OCD symptoms on platforms like Reddit, Quora, Facebook, and even the NOCD community feed, but they also encourage others who are silently suffering with undiagnosed OCD to realize that the turmoil they’re experiencing is a recognized subtype of OCD. People share detailed stories about living with their OCD subtype, and others read and relate to the content. ",p,,/blog/nocds-research-demonstrates-that-erp-therapy-is-effective-for-all-ocd-subtypes,95,4
543,"After one realizes that OCD is not just a personality quirk that’s synonymous with being uptight, the next question they often ask is “how do I get better?” Through continued research, many with OCD realize that the condition is chronic when left untreated, but that it can be effectively overcome with a specific type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). ",p,,/blog/nocds-research-demonstrates-that-erp-therapy-is-effective-for-all-ocd-subtypes,65,2
544,"ERP treatment centers around teaching people with OCD to respond to their fears in a more productive way by accepting uncertainty as opposed to stopping or neutralizing the obsessive fear via compulsive actions (i.e., compulsions) or other avoidant behaviors. In order to learn how to accept uncertainty, ERP-trained therapists will purposefully and creatively guide the person in triggering their OCD-related fear (i.e., through an exposure), and then teach them how to accept the uncertainty that accompanies the fear. Once accepting uncertainty becomes a new habit, as opposed to resorting to compulsive actions, the person with OCD typically experiences relief from their suffering. ",p,,/blog/nocds-research-demonstrates-that-erp-therapy-is-effective-for-all-ocd-subtypes,102,8

554,"Just Right obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype that is characterized by ongoing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors around organization, perfection and making things feel “just right.” People with Just Right OCD experience frequent intrusive thoughts around organization and symmetry, and they perform certain actions until they feel it is complete or “perfect” (e.g., switching a light switch on and off seven times before leaving a room). While other subtypes are motivated by specific fears and trying to avoid particular outcomes, with this subtype, the underlying anxiety is characterized by an unsettled feeling that something is just not right.",p,Just Right OCD Symptoms,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,100,6
555,"People who have Just Right OCD may fixate on parts of their body, like making sure their fingernails are the exact same length, their hair is perfectly arranged, or their makeup is applied perfectly and symmetrically. They may fixate on a certain structural asymmetry, like their nostrils, and attempt to perfect it by breathing in a certain way or spend time researching plastic surgery options that could correct it. Another common obsession for this OCD subtype is being fixated on physical sensations. So if someone touches your right arm by mistake, you must touch your left arm in the same place to “even it out”. This may also look like not avoiding stepping on cracks on the sidewalk, or making sure your steps are even.",,Just Right OCD Symptoms,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,125,6
556,"Other people with Just Right OCD may experience doubting thoughts about their written or verbal communication. A person may fixate on certain things they’ve said, or the specific words they are using while talking, and correct themselves mid-speech if the word isn’t perfectly representing what they wanted to express. A person may feel each sentence must be exactly the same length to be perfect and rewrite them until they are. Or they may reread texts or emails over and over before and after they are sent. They may struggle to make the shape of each word symmetrical and keep on finding new ones until they are. ",p,Just Right OCD Symptoms,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,106,6
557,"Someone with Just Right OCD may also be fixated on making their surroundings look just right and symmetrical. For some people, looking at a slightly tilted picture frame or images of houses where the windows and doors are uneven can cause intense anxiety. ",p,Just Right OCD Symptoms,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,43,3
558,"The compulsions people with this subtype experience are usually pretty straightforward and centered around trying to fix what they perceive to be imperfect or incomplete. Rearranging the picture frame. Fixing their hair. Choosing the right words. Tying the shoe on their right foot to match the tension of the shoe on their left foot. Reading emails 15 times before and after sending them. These compulsions can be incredibly time-consuming and can often cause people with Just Right OCD to run late to scheduled commitments in their life. It can also be socially isolating for people when their OCD forces them to engage in physical compulsions in the presence of others (e.g., switching a light switch seven times in front of a friend. People with this OCD subtype may find themselves avoiding situations entirely so that they don’t have to deal with the time and stress required to make things just right. Instead of re-reading an email 15 times before and after sending, they’ll just avoid writing the email in the first place. Just Right OCD can demand a tremendous amount of mental energy from a person, and cause them to lose hours of their day to compulsions. ",p,Just Right OCD Symptoms,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,197,14

560,"Fixing behaviors to make things just right: This is the most common compulsion for this subtype of OCD. When something appears out of order or incomplete, a person with Just Right OCD will try to make it right. This could mean measuring out their coffee as many times as needed until they are sure it’s the perfect amount. Or spending hours rewriting a brief email until it is perfect. The compulsion to fix things could be ritualized, like needing to turn a light switch on and off 5 times before leaving each room. It could look like repeatedly putting a shirt on until it feels right. These compulsions can range from quick activities that take a few seconds but can demand hours of a person’s day.",,Just Right OCD Compulsive Actions: Some Examples ,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,126,8
561,"Avoidance: Because people with Just Right OCD experience high levels of anxiety when things appear to be incomplete, they may avoid certain situations or places where they know their OCD will likely be triggered. For example, if someone needs to make sure each handwritten letter is exactly aligned, and this process takes hours, they may find themselves avoiding writing by hand. If sending a text message consumes hours of a person’s day because they have to read it repeatedly, they may decide it’s best to stop texting. ",p,Just Right OCD Compulsive Actions: Some Examples ,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,87,4
562,"Reassurance seeking: In certain situations, people with Just Right OCD may turn to friends or family for reassurance.

With a therapist, you’ll work toward overcoming this compulsion, with the goal of sending emails effectively and efficiently, without your compulsions interfering. A therapist may ask you to send an email without reading it at all. You might think, “That’s impossible!” If an exposure feels too overwhelming to start though, you’ll work with the therapist to find the right intensity for you. Maybe that’s reading the email twice before sending it. Once you choose a plan, you’ll work with your therapist on the emotions that come up during the exposures. It will be scary at first. It may bring up many of the fears you’ve been trying to alleviate with your compulsions (e.g., what if my email has mistakes and people judge me?) But with practice, you’ll find the intense need to engage in your compulsion will wane. You will get to a point where the anxiety subsides, and you no longer feel the need to reread your email at all. ",p,Example of Just Right OCD Exposures,/blog/just-right-perfectionism-ocd,189,12

People with contamination-related OCD symptoms may worry that they will get sick or infect someone else; they may respond by ramping up their hand-washing or cleaning efforts to the point of exhaustion and bodily harm.

622,"Being diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsions Disorder can be confusing and scary for both kids and parents. According to the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF), about half a million children in the United States have OCD, which is making the disorder a common unwanted guest in many American homes. ",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,47,3
623,"Some of the common themes of childhood OCD include contamination fears, checking rituals, perfectionism, excessive “just right” or bedtime rituals, and “bad thoughts.” Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the “gold standard” treatment for OCD. The treatment consists of engaging in exercises or “challenges” that gradually expose a child to the things or thoughts they are fearing while resisting engaging in safety behaviors or compulsions. Whew! Sounds like quite the undertaking for any adult, let alone a child. Even adults require motivators to do hard things. Through a child’s eyes, ERP can seem like an intimidating and aversive treatment- “You’re telling me I have to do what?!” For many children, having the “buy-in” to begin treatment can be a challenge. The use of incentives or rewards can be used effectively during the therapy process in order to raise kids’ motivation to engage in the exposures as well as feeling autonomous over the course of treatment. ",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,155,8
624,Following are some guidelines when developing an incentive/reward program for ERP:,p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,11,1
625,"First and foremost, educating the child about what OCD can look like is a powerful force to get the wheel of change turning. When children are empowered to understand that OCD is a harmless brain glitch that they do not have to listen to–and, in fact, can fight against–motivation can arise. Also, letting children know how common OCD is and that they are not alone can help alleviate their feelings of loneliness and challenge unhealthy stigmas.",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,76,4
626,Include the child as a stakeholder,p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,6,1
627,"A great way to begin talking about including incentives/rewards in treatment is to bring the child into the discussion from the beginning. All children are different; therefore, they all have different motivations. Allowing children to collaborate with parents and their therapist gives them considerable autonomy and shows them that they have a say and a sense of control in their own treatment… and that therapy can even involve some fun and games! Who wouldn’t have some fun with choosing their own personal reward system?",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,84,3
628,"Children are all motivated by different things, and those things can also change over the time of treatment. It is important to create a variety of incentives and make those incentives fit into your family’s budget, capabilities and personal preferences. A great way to have a variety of rewards to choose from is to include different categories of rewards such as material, experience, privilege and social rewards. It is also very important that the rewards can be deliverable within an appropriate time frame after the child engages in the exposure. Another tip is to avoid using incentives that the child would normally receive as this may feel punitive if the goal isn’t met. For example, if a child has always watched TV for 30 minutes before bedtime, we wouldn’t want that to be the incentive since it is something the child normally receives. However, an incentive can be having additional TV time after completing the exposure. ",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,156,8
629,Tracking incentives/rewards,p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,2,1
630,"Creating a system for tracking incentives and rewards can be a fun family project. In the beginning of therapy, it is beneficial for the child to be able to earn incentives/rewards frequently with the idea of spreading them out with time and more difficult exercises. With younger children a sticker chart can work very well. The child can also be involved in picking/making the chart as well as selecting the stickers. Remember to place the chart in a visible location such as on the fridge or in child’s room. It is important to be vigilant in filling in stickers as soon as the exposure or the “challenge” is completed. For older children using currency (hello Monopoly money), tokens, or “bravery tickets” are all great options. ",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,125,8
631,"An added bonus of utilizing an incentive/reward system is that it allows the child to be in control of earning the incentive. On the flip side, it allows for natural consequences to occur when the child doesn’t engage in the exposure. This brings a key component of making a rewards system work- the incentive/reward occurs only after the agree-upon exposure or “challenge” is completed. If the child chooses not to engage in the agreed-upon exposure, the incentive does not occur. Learning will happen quickly here: do the hard thing, earn a desirable reward. Motivation to do the hard thing grows due to incentive, and repeated exposure leads to new learning and defeating OCD.",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,113,7
632,Final tip,p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,2,1
633,"As children progress through treatment, they are able to see that they are getting better at defeating OCD and therefore they will become more internally motivated. There will be a time in treatment where the incentive becomes the bonus and not the main reason for engaging in exposure work, especially since once engaging kids are very responsive to ERP treatment and can see progress fairly quickly. Think of a reward system as a jumpstart to the OCD recovery journey.",p,,/blog/incentives-to-encourage-kids-engagement-in-erp-treatment,79,4

Mental compulsions involve doing something in your head to solve a problem or to “figure it out.” Do you feel a sense of anxiety and extreme urgency to get answers?

675,"Allison has been living with OCD for over a decade. She’s gone through treatment and recovery, but at times she still experiences compulsions she can’t control—specifically around locks and security. She was stuck.

It’s not validating me or supporting me at all when family members are like, ‘Just stop, don’t think about those things, don’t feel compulsive.’ It’s so much easier said than done.

685,"There are many different subtypes of OCD, and the condition affects everyone differently. But the pattern is generally the same: an intrusive thought, image, or urge causes anxiety and leads a person to engage in a compulsion. For example, a person with harm OCD, a subtype characterized by fear of hurting oneself or others, might experience obsessive thoughts about hurting themselves in their sleep. These fears and intrusive thoughts are distressing and disorienting, and the person experiencing them will often do everything they can to make them stop.

706,"If you have OCD, hang out in OCD communities online, or read articles about OCD, it will not take you long to see that there are many themes or categories—often called subtypes—that people use to identify their OCD symptoms. Though everyone’s experience is unique, many people with OCD share similar underlying elements, and their thoughts tend to center around particular themes. ",p,,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,61,3
707,"I like to refer to themes as flavors because while each one has a uniqueness to it, their cores are very similar: there’s a need for certainty and a sense of urgency that comes with their intrusive thoughts, images and urges. People may have several themes or just one, and these themes can also change from time to time. ",p,,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,59,3
708,"One of the reasons that some people find it beneficial to categorize their symptoms into a theme is because it can provide a sense of relief in itself. If you’ve been living with symptoms that were puzzling and that caused you to think the worst things about yourself, finding out that there are others who experience the same or similar feelings can be a life-changing experience. ",p,,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,66,3

710,"Identifying themes can help some people categorize areas that OCD often latches onto and the intrusive thoughts that center around these topics. Still, with all subtypes, doubt and uncertainty are the driving force. What a person’s OCD chooses to focus on can be a result of their environment; it might relate to things that they grew up valuing, or things that were taught to them. OCD attacks what people value. ",p,Doubt and uncertainty at the root,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,70,5
711,"For example, someone who grew up in a religious household where there were very high expectations for behavior may develop religious-themed obsessions.

They likely will be on high alert about anything that could be recognized as sinful or “wrong.” ",p,Doubt and uncertainty at the root,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,58,4
712,"OCD can attach itself to any category, even if most people experience similar themes. These categories are often topics that people are prone to avoid talking about. For many, these areas are shrouded in shame and guilt. It is almost as if OCD attaches itself to an individual’s most dreaded fears and the things that they find the most frightening. ",p,Doubt and uncertainty at the root,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,60,5

714,"The good news is that regardless of the OCD subtype, or the nature of the intrusive thoughts—whether violent, taboo, sexual, or otherwise upsetting and unwanted—all themes of OCD are treatable with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. ERP is the gold standard of treatment for OCD and involves specifically targeting the source of a person’s obsessions by directly exposing them to it. In most cases, people find that ERP helps their anxiety subside to the point where they no longer experience intense fears related to their thoughts on a regular basis. ",p,Treatment for OCD subtypes,/blog/how-erp-can-treat-all-ocd-themes,91,4

727,"Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), a behavioral therapy that falls under the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) umbrella, is the frontline treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The modality entails facing one’s fears head-on through exposure to feared stimuli while simultaneously preventing compulsive rituals (mental and physical). Through such exposure, one may habituate to the stimulus—the more they are exposed to a triggering stimulus, the less anxiety-provoking it becomes—and/or learn safety: that the feared outcome is far less likely than their brain makes it out to be. They also learn how to tolerate anxiety and discomfort in the face of a trigger while moving toward their values.",p,,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,106,5
728,"There’s a misconception about exposure therapy, and the nature of exposures in particular, which can lead to avoidance of the therapeutic modality itself. People may think that all exposures are as extreme as licking the inside of a toilet bowl. This is typically not the case, and I as a therapist would never do such a thing. Exposures frequently involve facing fears in everyday situations that a person with OCD avoids: changing their baby’s diaper, riding an elevator, using kitchen knives to chop vegetables, driving on the highway, etc. They can also involve writing down triggering words, looking at triggering images, watching TV shows that are triggering, and more.",p,,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,109,6
729,"Exposures can be anxiety-provoking, even when they’re things that most other people do on a daily basis. People with OCD have a hyperactive fear center in the brain, alerting them of danger when imminent danger is not actually present. While someone without OCD might not think twice about using knives to cook, a person with OCD using knives might experience comparable anxiety to being stuck on train tracks with a train speeding at you.",p,,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,74,4

732,"Those with OCD often compulsively avoid what they fear as it relates to their specific obsession. This could look like an avoidance of sexual intimacy for someone with unwanted sexual obsessions, an avoidance of driving for someone with “hit-and-run” obsessions, or an avoidance of bathing a newborn for someone with postpartum harm obsessions. Avoidance is a compulsion utilized in an attempt to escape anxiety and discomfort associated with obsessions, prevent something bad from happening, or reduce the likelihood of being triggered.",p,Your World Expands As You Change Behaviors,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,81,4
733,"On paper, avoidance seems like the answer. If you just avoid what your brain is telling you is dangerous, you won’t feel anxiety and nothing bad will happen, right? Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. In reality, when we avoid something, we are directly signaling to our brain that the thing that we are avoiding is dangerous. Our brain wants to keep us safe, after all, and avoidance fuels the ever-present nature of obsessions. It keeps the fear alive, validates obsessions, and leads us to believe that the false alarms are actually real alarms.",p,Your World Expands As You Change Behaviors,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,94,6
734,"While the reasons a person avoids may vary, the outcome remains similar: their life becomes smaller as activities of daily living are restricted. This is where ERP can help a person get their life back. As a person starts to face fears head-on, without compulsively avoiding, their world expands. In the case of someone with postpartum OCD, they can change their baby’s diaper, bathe them, play with them, and do other activities that were once avoided because of OCD. In the case of someone with hit-and-run OCD who stopped driving altogether, they can get their autonomy and independence back as they begin driving again.",p,Your World Expands As You Change Behaviors,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,104,6

Whether it’s dealing with death and loss or merely the struggles of everyday living, we must become more comfortable with discomfort to survive. This change in our relationship to discomfort is part of a successful ERP practice. We learn how to relate to anxiety and other uncomfortable emotions in a new way as we face our fears.

740,"Exposure therapists often build a hierarchy of exposures with their clients, ranked from 1-10 on an anxiety scale, that acts as a blueprint to follow throughout treatment. While therapists may jump around on the hierarchy at times and have clients do exposures at varying levels of anxiety, most therapists start out with lower-level exposures: a 3 or 4 out of 10 rather than a 10 out of 10 on the anxiety scale. One of the reasons for gradually moving up the hierarchy is to help the client build confidence in their ability to carry out the ERP work. By starting at a level 3 or 4, the client learns that they can face a fear head-on and tolerate lower levels of anxiety without performing rituals. This success and confidence that comes from lower levels of exposures can help a client buy into the more difficult exposures. ",p,You’ll Experience Enhanced Confidence,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,146,6
741,"This confidence does not just exist within a vacuum of the therapy office. ERP can build a client’s confidence to do hard things at any point in life. It is universal, as is tolerating discomfort. The more you face your fears head-on, the more assured you may be of your ability to tackle hard, scary, difficult things. Life is full of them.

748,"People with OCD often try to out-think the obsession, aka perform mental compulsions, and find themselves stuck in a game that is difficult to win. This is where, quoting Steven Hayes, getting out of your mind and into your life with ERP can be helpful. Instead of attempting to learn safety by convincing ourselves that the obsession is false, and staying immersed in the mind, we can learn safety by changing our behavior and showing our brain that the story is unhelpful. We can call OCD’s bluff and disconnect from the story by facing our fears head-on without performing compulsive rituals. When we do this, we often learn that the bad thing (that scary story) is not as likely to occur as our brain makes it out to be.We are not always in control of our thoughts (think those intrusive thoughts that happen to you) and feelings, but we are in control of our behavior. Changing our behavior through both exposure and response prevention can help us disconnect from those thoughts and feelings, and potentially change them. An example I often provide clients relates to feelings of self-worth and deservingness. It is difficult to think ourselves into feeling more worthy and deserving, but we can change our behavior and act as if we are. Treating ourselves as if we are worthy and deserving can change how we feel about ourselves.",p,ERP Helps Us Disconnect from Unhelpful Stories and Call OCD’s Bluff,/blog/5-benefits-of-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,230,11

750,"As someone with OCD and a therapist who specializes in the treatment of OCD, my experience has been that those who struggle with OCD often doubt themselves on a deep level and distrust their own experiences. They may doubt who they are and what they may be capable of. Fear and doubt overrule the logical part of them that knows what their values are, and understands that the thoughts that they are experiencing don’t align with their beliefs.",p,,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,78,4

752,You have likely heard that OCD is called the “doubting disorder”: this is because doubt is an underlying hallmark of this condition. People with OCD often lack trust in themselves and in whether or not an action has taken place. It can seem as though the parts of the brain that remember past events—even events that took place minutes before—are sometimes hindered. ,p,Never being quite sure enough,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,62,4
753,"This can cause them to feel unsure about even the most mundane of activities, such as whether they locked a door, which may cause them to repeatedly check to ensure it is locked. Fueling this is an insatiable feeling that often tells them “I need to redo this or figure out an answer, just in case it means something.”",p,Never being quite sure enough,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,59,3
754,"Many people that I have worked alongside would say they know logically that what they are experiencing is a mental glitch of sorts; for example, they know they checked they locked the door. And yet, there is this nagging pull that says “but what if you didn’t?” ",p,Never being quite sure enough,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,47,2
755,"Though the triggers and fears differ, the commonality for many people with OCD is the need to re-examine information in great detail in an attempt to find complete certainty. One member I worked with would have to say the same very specific prayer any time she felt triggered. This could take up a significant amount of time because she would question whether she had included certain parts of the prayer just mere seconds after having said it. Another person I treated feared coming into contact with items that could be potentially contaminated and would excessively ask his partner for reassurance about whether or not he had touched them. Even after his partner had confirmed he had not, it would only take minutes before he felt compelled to ask again, never feeling quite sure enough. ",p,Never being quite sure enough,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,134,6

757,"People with OCD often report a lack of confidence in their ability to make decisions or recall events correctly. It has been suggested that people with OCD may have an impaired ability to rely on the past. Not being able to rely on past information or memories may lead them to question not only past events, experiences, and feelings, but also causes them to perceive unpredictability when faced with similar circumstances in the present. ",p,Feeling stuck in a spiral of “what ifs” and “just in case”,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,74,4
758,"This means that people with OCD may have trouble believing something even when evidence exists that it is factual. By rechecking or redoing tasks, they are actually experiencing further distrust in their memory and confidence to accurately recall what has taken place. In other words, the more a person with OCD tries to review events or feelings that have taken place, the less likely they are to feel confident in what took place—all of which leads to greater anxiety. ",p,Feeling stuck in a spiral of “what ifs” and “just in case”,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,79,4
759,"These feelings of doubt and mistrust often lead people to feel “stuck” in a seemingly endless spiral of thoughts, with questions of “what if?” haunting them night and day. Even when they feel confident “enough” about something, there is still often a lingering need to perform a compulsion “just in case.” The act of engaging in compulsions almost always inadvertently teaches their brain that they must do them to prevent any danger. ",p,Feeling stuck in a spiral of “what ifs” and “just in case”,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,72,4
760,"What we know, however, is that people do not need to “do” anything when they are triggered by OCD fears—they are able to tolerate the feelings of anxiety and uncertainty due to intrusive thoughts, feelings, and urges, even as uncomfortable as they are. The less the person gives in to doing a compulsion for temporary relief, the less that faulty danger signal goes off in their brain in the long run. ",p,Feeling stuck in a spiral of “what ifs” and “just in case”,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,71,3
761,"Most people without OCD can accept some uncertainty—an example would be that a person who is not struggling with OCD can likely drive down a busy highway, pass by several people walking near the street, and accept with reasonable probability that they have not hit someone with their vehicle. By contrast, someone who has OCD might be in that same situation and mistrust their entire experience. They may think, “how can I be sure I didn’t hit someone? What if I did and I am now responsible for their death?” ",p,Feeling stuck in a spiral of “what ifs” and “just in case”,/blog/why-ocd-may-cause-you-to-distrust-yourself,90,3

864,"Community-driven therapy solutions are particularly important in the mental health community, since mental health issues impact all areas of life. For example, a mother with postpartum OCD, a segment of the OCD community that affects 7.8% of new mothers, might view herself as a monster and then avoid her newborn daughter out of fear of physically harming her. She might also even remove herself from her social circles to prevent triggering her fear and become depressed.

Instead, a community-driven therapy service like NOCD would use its provider network and technology to identify and treat “what’s really wrong” with the mother – her violent intrusive thoughts about harming her child – knowing that the constant distress from the core issue is actually what’s causing her to feel extremely anxious and depressed. ",p,,/blog/nocd-offers-community-driven-not-condition-specific-therapy,81,3

Having a focus on offering extreme personalization also fuels community-driven therapy solutions like NOCD to differentiate from generalist services. For instance, 90% of people with OCD experience comorbid behavioral health or substance use disorders, and there are hundreds of OCD subtypes that each feel like unique experiences. A person with sexual orientation OCD and depression from rural Pennsylvania might have a different treatment plan and experience than someone suffering with existential OCD and hoarding disorder in South Florida, although both go through ERP therapy. ",p,,/blog/nocd-offers-community-driven-not-condition-specific-therapy,100,5

890,"There are a few things to look out for if you think you may have OCD: are you experiencing intrusive thoughts, images or urges that you find to be really disturbing or inappropriate? Do they lead you to feel guilty, shameful, anxious, or disgusted? And when you have these, if you do something to try to neutralize them, or to decrease the anxiety or disgust or shame that you feel, that’s a sign that you might be doing compulsions. ",p,,/blog/how-do-i-recognize-that-i-have-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,79,2
891,"Obsessions in OCD are these intrusive thoughts, images or urges that people experience, and compulsions are either behaviors that you can see physically or mental acts that you might be performing, like maybe counting or praying. You do those to neutralize the effect of the obsession. You find that obsession to be something that you don’t want, so you want to neutralize it.",p,,/blog/how-do-i-recognize-that-i-have-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,63,4
892,"One phrase we sometimes use for these thoughts, images, or urges is “ego dystonic,” meaning that they don’t feel like a part of us or don’t align with who we are as a person; they’re outside of who we see ourselves as. So we want to neutralize that to make it go away, because if we don’t, we fear that something bad might happen, or we might be at fault for something that could occur. ",p,,/blog/how-do-i-recognize-that-i-have-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,75,3
893,"Once we neutralize it, we typically feel really good. That compulsion kind of wipes away the obsession, but the relief is only temporary. That feeling maintains us, and we continue to do those compulsions because we know it’s the way to feel better. That’s why people get stuck, why they keep having these intrusive thoughts, and they keep doing whatever they can to try to make them go away. It’s a cycle that keeps happening over and over again: sometimes I refer to it as a really unfortunate hamster wheel that we find ourselves on, and we just keep going around and around. And we don’t know how to get off. ",p,,/blog/how-do-i-recognize-that-i-have-obsessive-compulsive-disorder,111,7

When her teacher asked her why she needed to do this, she refused to answer. After several visits to the school counselor’s office, she finally opened up and said that she has to do certain things in a certain way for a certain amount of time so that no one she loves will die. At one point, Emily was having to go back and redo these steps in various doorways up to 10 times a day. She also had begun to touch items throughout the classroom over and over again.

If your teen is uncomfortable sharing personal details about their OCD with their teachers, perhaps having an escape plan in place for when they feel that the anxiety is unbearable is the best course of action.

Just as adults thrive in structured and predictable environments, kids do, too.

921,"That is why it’s key not to focus so much on the particular theme, fear, or concern the child has, but rather on the underlying components of the disorder. OCD causes people to doubt everything and to fixate on the what-ifs. OCD will try and convince them that this time it really is different and so they must do what OCD tells them to do. This often sounds like “if I do this compulsion just one more time, then everything will be okay.” The more they are aware of the way that OCD works and are equipped to respond to it, the less likely they are to fall for it.

We know that OCD often attaches itself to things or people we value, so what affects one child with OCD will be different for another, even though they have the same disorder. To help bring awareness, it is important to first identify or recognize what your child values. Then help your child understand that the thoughts OCD latches onto are ego-dystonic, meaning that they are aligned with what your child desires. That is why your child is so troubled by the thoughts and why they get “stuck” on them. It can be beneficial to help them separate who they are from what they think.

935,"Somatic obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype characterized by ongoing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors around one’s somatic experience — the physical sensations they can’t control. For example, someone with somatic OCD may be fixated on the pace and/or size of their breaths or the rate of their blinking or heart beating. These intrusive thoughts can take over a person’s ability to think about anything else and lead to intense fears about the severity of their condition (“If I am not blinking enough, I could lose my ability to see.”). In an attempt to stop these intrusive thoughts, people with somatic OCD will engage in compulsions aimed at making them go away (e.g., carefully monitoring their blinking to “check” if it is frequent enough).",p,,/blog/what-is-somatic-ocd,125,8

Breathing used to happen naturally, but it’s become the only thought this person’s mind can focus on. Their breath now seems excessively loud, and it drowns out all their other thoughts.

Eventually, you may find you’re able to hear the noise your chewing makes without experiencing an unbearable amount of stress.

1016,"From an OCD standpoint, to be triggered is to experience something in a situation or an environment that causes you to have an intrusive thought, image, or urge, or reminds you of a previous one. Essentially, a trigger is anything that leads to an OCD obsession. Once triggered, you may start to feel anxiety and discomfort. The members I work with in therapy often say that triggers can seemingly come out of nowhere, immediately demanding their full attention. ",p,,/blog/what-does-it-actually-mean-for-ocd-to-be-triggered,78,5

Did I feel an attraction to them?” Or perhaps you drive home from work at night and hear a news story on the radio about a hit-and-run. Worries strike one after another: “Did I drive by there?

1035,Existential OCD or a ‘Deep Thinker’? How to Tell The Difference,h1,title,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,11,1
1036,"Existential OCD is characterized by the preoccupation with philosophical questions related to life and existence. For example, someone with existential OCD might experience intrusive thoughts centered on the meaning of life, the universe, and/or their human existence. They might experience frequent doubt about their perceptions of reality. Someone with existential OCD might also experience recurrent feelings of depersonalization and derealization, which only exacerbate their doubts about their experiences of reality. They might also frequently question the purpose of life. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,79,6
1037,"As with other presentations of OCD, it is helpful to look beyond the content of the obsessions and consider more the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Just as someone with religious scrupulosity might appear to be an extremely devout follower of their faith, someone with existential OCD might appear to be a “deep thinker.” In fact, there is a whole field devoted to figuring out the meaning of life, and yet, not every philosopher has existential OCD. ",,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,79,4
1038,"So, what’s the difference? The meaning one makes of their thoughts, the urgent distress one feels because of their thoughts, and the behaviors that follow this distress, is what separates people with OCD from those with a genuine interest in existential inquiries. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,42,2
1039,"Commonly, individuals with existential OCD experience an urgency to arrive at some sort of answer to these unanswerable questions. The lack of conclusion causes anguish for these individuals, which detracts from their ability to engage in their lives in a fulfilling and meaningful way. For example, while spending time with loved ones, these individuals might be stuck in a vortex of questioning if their loved ones are actually real. They might be questioning if they are actually present or if their perceptions of reality are wrong. Or, they might be trying to figure out what the meaning of these interactions are if there is no actual definitive meaning to life at all. These are just some examples of the way existential OCD might present in people’s lives. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,127,7
1040,"This sort of anguished search for meaning is not to be confused with the sense of ruminative hopelessness and meaninglessness that is common among people with depression, nor is it the equivalent to the type of endless sense of worrying germane to Generalized Anxiety Disorder. What distinguishes existential obsessions from the aforementioned experiences is the presence of compulsions. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,58,3
1041,"Common compulsions for individuals with existential OCD include mental checking/testing to gauge if one feels in touch with reality, ruminating in hopes that “this time” they will find the answers, and excessive research and reading of philosophical and scientifics texts.  Conversely, some may engage in avoidance of anything related to this topic, such as movies about simulations and videos about the universe, space, or the meaning of life. Individuals with existential OCD commonly also seek reassurance from others by asking them for their answers to their obsessive questions or asking them how they perceive reality. ",,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,95,4
1042,"As is true for other themes of OCD, the best treatment for existential OCD is Exposure and Response Prevention. Unfortunately, as is common for many people with OCD, many individuals may end up in traditional talk therapy before they land in the right treatment. The rationale for ERP over traditional talk therapy is based on the idea that discussing possible answers to these unanswerable questions is, in fact, a compulsion. Even purely cognitive approaches, like the use of thought challenging and cognitive reframing, reinforce the idea that the individual in treatment sincerely needs to pay these thoughts any mind at all. Just like with other forms of OCD, when an individual uses an ERP approach, they learn to treat these thoughts just as they would treat anything else their imaginative brain spews out. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,133,6
1043,"In ERP, the individual would purposely approach the sources of their anxiety, allowing their distress to arise while actively resisting any sort of attempts to decrease their distress. Exposures can vary from person to person, but some general examples might include: ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,41,2
1044,"After engaging in these exposures, response prevention is key. It could be helpful to remind  individuals with OCD that people have been trying to figure out the answers to your obsessional questions since the beginning of time, and the likelihood that they are the one to unlock these answers is close to nil. Combine this infinitesimal likelihood with the fact that all of their attempts to think their way out of distress has only led them deeper into suffering– their options are to suffer more, or to sit with their distress right now, giving themselves a chance to learn that they don’t have to have an answer. ",p,,/blog/existential-ocd-deep-thinker-how-to-tell-difference,107,4
1045,"If you have existential OCD, I encourage you to think about what else you could do with the time and energy you have been spending on compulsions.

Beating OCD means not falling prey to the “normal trap,” or engaging in compulsive behaviors because it’s what everyone else is doing. Your friends might take relationship quizzes online for fun to see how compatible they are with their partner, or check in with their partner regularly to see how satisfied and happy the other person is in the relationship. Friends and family may also talk to one another about their relationships and try to get feedback or advice when they are struggling.

When it comes to behaviors that are or were compulsions, it can be helpful to ask yourself if you want to do the behavior, or if you feel like you have to do the behavior. If you want to do it, proceed with caution. Give it a limit. Do the behavior once, and if you don’t trust the answer, or it doesn’t feel right, still only do it once.

Finding the balance between these can be challenging, but well worth it. ",p,From a coping mechanism to a compulsion,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,93,5
1142,"Staying busy by doing the things that one enjoys and values is not a distraction, it is living the life you want to live. It is being mindful of the moment in front of you. It is choosing to live the life that you envision for yourself, in spite of difficult feelings. This involves allowing the uncomfortable emotions to be present along with intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images and urges, and continuing to do the things that you want to be doing. It is not allowing your feelings to dictate your actions.",p,From a coping mechanism to a compulsion,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,92,6
1143,"However, when someone has OCD, there is a tendency to not want to confront difficult things or feelings, which can lead to a reliance on distracting oneself. Intrusive thoughts, images, and urges can make feeling hard things even more difficult. There is a greater tendency to want to escape these, especially because they are ego-dystonic, meaning that they often go against the person’s values. It makes sense that beliefs or thoughts that are foreign or go against one’s views would create confusion. The temptation to want to escape and distract as a means of coping is a common one, and yet one that we don’t want to engage in when we have OCD. ",p,From a coping mechanism to a compulsion,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,113,6
1144,"Distraction can lead to actively avoiding difficult feelings. It is purposeful and meant to divert your attention away from the anxiety caused by OCD. It is making a deliberate choice to try to not think about the thoughts, images, or urges that bring undesirable feelings to the surface. Think of it as running away from or hiding from feelings. When this happens, you are inadvertently teaching yourself that you cannot handle those particular thoughts or emotions. The more often that this process occurs, the more your brain believes that there is a real danger in allowing these feelings. The end result is that you start to notice these feelings more often, and you become hyper-vigilant towards them. The fearful emotions actually grow bigger instead of shrinking. Distraction may feel good in the short term but it never lasts when you have OCD.",p,From a coping mechanism to a compulsion,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,142,10

1146,"A more helpful way of combatting the difficult emotions that come along with OCD is taught during exposure and response prevention (ERP)—the gold standard OCD treatment. In ERP, you will learn that the feelings are not dangerous and that you do not need to avoid experiencing them. You will also learn that you do not need to attach meaning to thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness can be effective in helping you along this process. Mindfulness skills are valuable to learn for the ERP work, as they help people accept the presence of thoughts and feelings (like anxiety or discomfort) that arise during exposures without engaging with them compulsively (like through distraction).",p,Using ERP and mindfulness in place of compulsive distraction,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,110,6
1147,"Mindfulness involves the practice of passively acknowledging the thoughts and feelings that are present and continuing in activities that bring you fulfillment. You learn the importance of moving towards your values in spite of how you feel. The more you do this, the less the feelings of discomfort and anxiety tend to be present. Your brain relearns that these feelings are not actually dangerous and that you can tolerate them. The more you recognize this, the less the feelings tend to arise. Instead of running from your thoughts and feelings, you learn how to let them be there while you go about living your life. But, this takes a great deal of practice and commitment.",p,Using ERP and mindfulness in place of compulsive distraction,/blog/can-distraction-become-a-compulsion,115,8

1155,"People with magical thinking OCD experience frequent intrusive thoughts, images or urges around superstition, colors and numbers. They may worry they’ll potentially harm themselves or others through negative thoughts, fearing that what’s in their head may influence reality. It’s stressful and frightening to think you could be liable for hurting a loved one just because the wrong image popped into your head. So, in response, people use compulsions to find relief from their distress. That might mean counting to 100 each time they make a phone call, making sure to follow each negative thought with five positive thoughts, or fixating on a specific sound or phrase. ",p,,/blog/magical-thinking-exposures-explanation-examples-ocd-treatment,106,6

If you’re convinced something bad will happen when you don’t perform a specific ritual, it can feel scary to prevent yourself from doing it. You might think, “Why would I take the risk of something bad happening?” Or, “Maybe treatment isn’t for me. Maybe I can live with this type of OCD.

I think that people outside of the OCD community would be shocked to discover that OCD can be so all-consuming, so hellish, that taking one’s own life could somehow begin to appear as a viable option. But that’s how it seemed to me immediately before having the good fortune to find and commit to therapy that works. I got on that road to recovery in 2020.

I had a religious upbringing and was raised in Assemblies of God. In church, I remember hearing that the only unforgivable sin was to say something bad about the Holy Spirit. Well, my OCD was awakened and latched onto this tidbit because, from that point on, the words “stupid Jesus” and “stupid Holy Spirit” wouldn’t stop coming to my mind.  ",p,OCD’s First Appearance in My Life,/blog/i-wouldnt-be-here-without-specialized-ocd-therapy,87,6

I’d also tell the intrusive thoughts to shut up because I didn’t know whether it was coming from the Devil or me. That was the compulsion I used to avoid the worst-case scenario, which, in this case, was spending eternity in Hell. ",p,OCD’s First Appearance in My Life,/blog/i-wouldnt-be-here-without-specialized-ocd-therapy,63,6

I’d never used that word. I’d never written it down. I didn’t even know where it came from. It wasn’t long before other slurs for Black people that came up constantly for me after I moved back home.

I began ending relationships with people who were not classified as “white” because I felt that I didn’t deserve to be their friend or that I didn’t deserve to be in a relationship with them because of this despicable content.

1248,"This racial OCD went on, untreated, until June 2017. At that point, things really went south. There were a lot of violent, sexual themes that surfaced with panic. While I’d always harbored the idea that someone was going to harm me because of what had happened when I was a kid, I started to think: “Well, what if I went crazy and harmed someone?” Because this was untreated, it caused me to ruminate so much that I’d have constant panic attacks.",p,The Emergence of Racism OCD,/blog/i-wouldnt-be-here-without-specialized-ocd-therapy,81,5

I had visions of going to Walmart and yelling a false confession of being a pervert or pedophile because I now thought that I’d lose all my morals and become what I hated. The intrusive fear and emotions that come with OCD are not logical at all. I was so scared that I was going to say something awful or do something terrible to someone that, within ten months, I was housebound with agoraphobia (or extreme avoidance). I didn’t leave my street for three years because of OCD. ",p,The Emergence of Racism OCD,/blog/i-wouldnt-be-here-without-specialized-ocd-therapy,105,6

While it is commonly known as TOCD, a more accurate description may be Gender Identity OCD (GOCD).  ",p,,/blog/transgender-ocd-symptoms-and-treatment,84,7

1282,"As the idea of transitioning away from your gender assigned at birth has entered mainstream public discourse, there has also been a rise in reports of TOCD. Hearing about transgender people in the media or at school may cause someone to question their own gender identity, which is perfectly healthy and for some may lead to a fulfilling and appropriate gender transition. For many people, it’s a fleeting thought that disappears. But for people with TOCD (also referred to as GOCD), that momentary doubt can snowball into an ever-deepening cycle of obsessions and compulsions, as the person gets caught up in a circle of doubt and wondering that in reality has little to do with their true gender identity.  ",p,,/blog/transgender-ocd-symptoms-and-treatment,119,5

The fear is not that cisgender or transgender is wrong or bad, in fact, it really has nothing to do with gender at all. While the actual core fears can vary from person to person, they typically revolve around three central themes: 1. What if I am not who I have always thought I was?

This results in compulsions, which can take on many different forms; for some, it may involve very detailed rituals they feel they must perform to prevent something very specific from occurring.

Many students do this, so you’re aware that it’s not an unusual request, but you just can’t seem to send the email.

For example, a compulsion might begin by putting your clothes in a plastic bag to be washed every time you come home from a public place. But it could escalate to needing to throw away your clothes if you were in an enclosed space. In many cases, it’s a downward spiral. The more your compulsions are driving you, the more you feel distress and try to prevent them. The more distress you feel, the more you lean on your compulsions to cope.

1492,"The best way for someone with OCD to manage their symptoms is by working with an OCD-trained therapist. If you notice a loved one struggling with OCD, recommending therapy can be an incredibly effective way to help someone with contamination OCD. The best treatment for someone with OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. This therapy differs from traditional talk therapy in that it uses behavioral therapy to target obsessions and compulsions. . Basically, a person with OCD works with a therapist to expose themselves to stimuli that trigger their obsessions, and then sits with the distressing feelings without acting on the compulsion. People complete exposures and engage in response prevention where they don’t engage in compulsions repeatedly which allows them to incorporate new learning. ERP works because it provides opportunities for new learning. Engaging in exposure and resisting compulsions teaches people with OCD that their fears will not come true, that they can handle their distress in the event they do occur, and they are able to tolerate uncertainty, anxiety, and other distress. ",p,Ways to Help,/blog/help-someone-with-contamination-ocd,175,10
1493,"For example,  someone with contamination OCD might avoidtouching a doorknob without covering their hands with their sleeve due to fear that they will contract a disease. An ERP therapist would encourage the patient to intentionally touch doorknobs without covering their hands, washing their hands immediately after, or engaging in other compulsions. Over time the individual might find that their practice gets easier and the uncomfortable feelings subside faster or that their feared outcome hasn’t come true. By learning into the discomfort and uncertainty, the person learns they don’t need their compulsions to cope. ",p,Ways to Help,/blog/help-someone-with-contamination-ocd,93,5

Another way to think about mental tracking is as a form of self-reassurance, in which a person tries to gather as much evidence as possible to assure themselves of some conclusion (e.g., “My spouse must love me. She’s been with me for 5 years, has never talked about wanting a divorce, and always says ‘I love you’ before she leaves for work.”)",p,R-OCD Compulsions: Some Examples,/blog/relationship-ocd,163,9
1602,"Social comparisons/Checking: This could look like spending hours on social media, examining other people’s relationships, and asking yourself questions like, are they happier than I am? It could also look like spending time thinking about your friends’ relationships and comparing them with yours. For example, if your obsessive thought is: should we be married by now? You might think about every married couple you know, and do a deep dive investigation on your social media to try to figure out how long it took each couple you know to get married in an attempt to answer whether your relationship is normal. ",p,R-OCD Compulsions: Some Examples,/blog/relationship-ocd,101,3
1603,"Some of these symptoms might seem pretty common. Almost everyone compares themselves to others on social media and at times wants to know what their friends think. While relationship doubts are normal at one point or another, one criteria to diagnose R-OCD is whether someone spends at least one hour per day on these obsessions and compulsions. Another important factor is that the obsessions and compulsions are carried from one relationship to the next, independent of how well the relationship is going. ",p,R-OCD Compulsions: Some Examples,/blog/relationship-ocd,82,5

1609,"While traditional talk therapy is effective for treating different issues, it can potentially be counterproductive for R-OCD. Here is a brief example. Say you are worried about whether you’re with the right person. In talk therapy, you might focus on how you are actually in a great relationship. The therapist might say something like, “I’ve known you for five years, and I think this is the happiest you’ve been with a person. You’ve talked a lot about how this person makes you happy. Is there something specific that’s bothering you about them now?” Although this comment may feel helpful for someone concerned about their relationship, for someone struggling with R-OCD, it may fulfill the compulsive need for reassurance.  ",p,Relationship OCD ERP Therapy ,/blog/relationship-ocd,118,8

ERP takes a targeted approach to address your obsessions and compulsions. An ERP-trained therapist will help by reviewing which thoughts or scenarios are causing you the most anxiety, and then work with you to come up with a specialized treatment plan to alleviate them through gradual, controlled exposure to them. In this case, rather than engaging in reassurance seeking, you might spend time with your therapist getting to the bottom of this stressful thought. What might happen if you actually are with the wrong person?",p,Relationship OCD ERP Therapy ,/blog/relationship-ocd,110,5
1611,"The idea behind ERP therapy is that exposure to these thoughts and the discomfort is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually submit to the urge to do the compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety as you provide yourself with opportunities to change your learning and practice living with uncertainty.",p,Relationship OCD ERP Therapy ,/blog/relationship-ocd,88,4

Let’s say you’ve identified with your therapist that every time your partner makes a joke you don’t find funny, suddenly you’re questioning their sense of humor and whether you’re really meant to be together.

So the next time your partner makes an unfunny joke and your obsessive doubts kick in, instead of reaching for the phone to call your friend, you’ll sit with the anxiety that comes from thinking you may be with the wrong partner. This may be overwhelming at first, so you’ll work with your therapist to come up with specific goals tailored to what makes sense for you. Maybe the first few times you’ll wait 10 minutes before calling your friend. The next time you’ll wait an hour, and then maybe an hour and a half, until eventually, you will get to a point where the anxiety subsides as you learn to tolerate uncertainty and  you no longer need to call them at all ",,Example of Relationship OCD Exposures ,/blog/relationship-ocd,143,5

1621,"My first experience with teletherapy was when I was in my postdoctoral fellowship. I was in St. Louis and there was a clinic in rural Missouri that had no access to psychiatrists. To provide that access, a special phone line was installed (I believe they called it a T1 line) to link to the psychiatrists in St. Louis and there was a very expensive setup with large cameras and bulky televisions.

1622,"While an experience like this was available in some clinics for a very large investment, until the last two years, almost no therapist training program focused on virtual treatment, and I would estimate that over 95% of therapists received only in-person session training.

1627,"OCD is the occurrence of obsessions—thoughts, images, or urges that one may find to be disgusting, unacceptable, shameful, guilt-ridden, or anxiety-provoking. To neutralize these obsessions, people with OCD will do compulsions—physical or mental acts—as an attempt to rid their minds of the thoughts, images, or urges.

I can ask them to turn the stove on, then turn it off, and then walk away from it without checking it again for the rest of the session. That allows me to help them address their specific fears and concerns during the session, and I can teach them to live with the discomfort and doubt instead of going back, again and again, to see if the stove is on or off.

I don’t know if being without my mom will ever get better or will feel “normal.” What I do know is that I am going on in spite of my worst fear happening.

OCD wants answers and will stop at nothing to get them. That is why compulsions occur: they are an attempt at gaining some kind of control or peace in a stressful situation.

On average, people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who enroll in NOCD Therapy not only experience significant reductions in OCD severity, going from high-risk to a low-risk levels, but they also experience substantial reductions in the severity of comorbidities—conditions that often result from OCD going untreated. These outcomes are proven across all OCD subtypes. Further, our clinical outcomes were recently published in a leading peer-reviewed journal, JMIR, in the largest OCD treatment study ever recorded. ",p,,/blog/the-nocd-way-offering-an-elite-treatment-experience-starts-with-over-investing-in-our-therapists,87,5

Prospective NOCD Therapists also have an opportunity to receive additional training in different sub-specializations at this step. For instance, some therapists gain additional expertise in Habit Reversal Training (HRT) to treat those with comorbid Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs), while others receive training in Prolonged Exposure Therapy to serve members who have trauma that sometimes prevents them from doing ERP treatment effectively for their OCD. ",p,Comprehensive Training And Clinical Supervision,/blog/the-nocd-way-offering-an-elite-treatment-experience-starts-with-over-investing-in-our-therapists,91,4

1706,"Balanced Schedules: Every full-time NOCD Therapist is required to meet a minimum range of 25-28 clinical hours each week. This ensures that therapists have time in their workweek to do necessary tasks that take place outside of the sessions, to plan, and to have time for breaks. To work 25-28 clinical hours, therapists would typically need to schedule between about 30-32 hours of member sessions per week, due to some members ending up needing to reschedule, e.g., during the week. To put that into perspective, most hospitals require a minimum of 35-40 clinical hours per week, or three 12-hour shifts, so our minimum is less than a hospital, but still enough time to see the amount of NOCD members needed to keep growing professionally. ERP requires more from therapists than most other types of therapy, so enough time for breaks is important.

For example, therapists who once charged $350 per session as a boutique private practice now have competition from providers who take insurance and objectively can prove that they offer the same quality services. Additionally, private practices that elect to use insurance to compete do not have the same economies of scale benefits as group practices to navigate the revenue cycle system. To prevent therapists from having to navigate the rapidly changing behavioral health industry, we remove this existential stressor completely from their plates and handle all marketing efforts internally.

1755,"Upon starting college, Mollie Albanese found herself in an uncomfortable situation: an unfamiliar dorm room, with two unfamiliar girls, in an unfamiliar place.",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,23,2
1756,"Mollie had social anxiety, which made living with two party-happy roommates difficult. But what she was also discovering was that the newness of it all was hard. Between moving into a new dorm, finding a new routine and a new way of living — it all became a bit too much. “There were so many things that I was used to doing a certain way because I was in my home, where I was comfortable,” she says. “And then I went to college and you’re thrown in with strangers. So I felt like things kind of got worse, in large part because I was not in my home.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,108,7
1757,"As a kid growing up in Pennsylvania, Mollie says, she had a constant feeling of not being present. “I just remember that I was not really able to enjoy the things that were happening around me,” she says. “When I was young, I would always ask my parents, what’s coming next? I would always need to know, what was the schedule for tomorrow? What was tomorrow going to look like? Even if we were on vacation, I needed to know what was going to happen next. ",,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,86,4

1759,"That stuck feeling was exacerbated in college, and in fact, being there constituted a low point. Everything was different. The routines and structures she built growing up vanished overnight. “It was so lonely,” she remembers. “I was just terrified to leave my dorm room. I wouldn’t want to go to class. I would, but then I’d come right back. It was only then that I felt safe, that I was free from other people.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,74,9
1760,"While sitting in her “closet” of a dorm room, thinking about the fear that came along with leaving the room and having to encounter new routines in a strange environment, Mollie realized that something was wrong. “It was a breaking point,” she says. “I was not doing what I wanted to be doing. I needed help.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,56,5

1764,"For Mollie, it was the start of a nearly 10-year journey to get properly diagnosed with OCD.

I felt like I got my life back. I could actually focus and be present for the things I wanted to be present for.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,56,7
1767,"For Mollie, it was a lightbulb moment. It underscored just how much she was struggling. “I just thought it was anxiety,” she says. “I didn’t know it was OCD. I didn’t know what was right. And so, looking back on my life now, I realized I was impacted by OCD. And I had no idea. For NOCD to be so non-judgemental, so understanding, it was just such a good experience.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,70,9
1768,"Because of the virtual nature of NOCD, Mollie was able to show her therapist her triggers in real time, creating a real-world ERP environment. “I literally took her from room to room,” she says. “And she had me practice my exposures right over the computer during my sessions.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,48,4

1772,"Mollie wants to be able to help break the stigma of OCD. She’s an active advocate on Instagram and hopes to show that OCD is not necessarily what’s portrayed in the media. “The media wants you to believe it’s just like this quirky little thing that people do, that they clean more than they should,” she says. “And it really has nothing to do with that. Unfortunately, it’s just this really common thought that that’s what OCD is. So growing up, I had no idea it was more than that. I was thinking like I’m the only person that’s ever gone through this, that there can’t be anyone else that has these feelings. And that’s obviously wrong.”",p,,/blog/scrupulosity-symmetry-somatic-ocd-subtype-testimonial,117,9
1773,"Now, she is in a position to change that narrative, helping patients on their healing journey. “This therapy gave me my life back,” she says. “It just blows my mind that I can make a living out of that. Because I remember what that’s like. I know what it’s like to be struggling and to not know where to go and to now know where to proceed. So when I speak to these members, they are lost.

The difference is that people who haven’t done ERP therapy with a specialist have not received the personalized guidance needed to know how to respond to sudden, unplanned exposures by resisting all of their compulsions and mindfully accepting uncertainty—that type of response prevention is the “RP” in ERP. As a result, they continue to respond to these exposures with compulsions, and their OCD only gets worse over time. This is because the more people engage in compulsions, the more they become reliant on those compulsions—meaning they become more time-consuming, distressing, and cause more interference in their lives.

1846,"OCD is classified as a severe mental illness by the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) and one of the top ten of the most disabling illnesses according to the World Health Organization, affecting 2.3% of the population. OCD can cost people affected and their families upwards of tens of thousands of dollars a year. ",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,55,4
1847,"As shown by the Epidemiological Catchment Area surveys, the economic impact of OCD marked in social and work-related occupational impairment was estimated to be $8.4 billion in 1990. They estimated that the indirect costs of OCD, reflecting lost productivity, were estimated at $6.2 billion, “not including lost opportunities for career advancement and the cost to families and carers over their respective working lifetimes.” The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the U.K. referred to one report which estimated that, on average, a person with OCD loses 3 years of income over their lifetime. OCD also costs payers and employers billions annually primarily because OCD is under-represented in healthcare claims, leading to inappropriate care that promotes healthcare system overutilization and, ultimately, extends suffering for people with OCD.",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,129,9
1848,"For me, the financial costs of having OCD have always been very high. I couldn’t even begin to put a cost on the number of things I have given away, thrown away, or repurchased. Personally, I have always had concerns about what I considered to be outdated food, or food being in the refrigerator for too long. My family often points out that I am wasteful when it comes to food. It is not my best quality, to be sure, but the truth is that this is part of how OCD affects me. I have always had intrusive thoughts about food going bad and people getting sick if they eat something spoiled. ",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,112,7
1849,"I know that over the years, I have thrown away many foods because either I thought it looked weird, smelled inexplicably off, or was even a day past its best-of date. The idea that leftovers can last three days seems like too much. On more than one occasion, I have thrown away everything in the freezer, convinced it was freezer-burned because I saw frost on it. If people gave me food, I often would thank them but then throw it away; I couldn’t seem to risk that something could be wrong with it.",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,93,5
1850,"I also had obsessions about the colors of my food. There was a time when I could be a quarter of the way into a meal and would have a scary thought that would be tied to a color, and then I had to throw away and avoid all foods with that color. Not to mention my contamination fears: if something became “contaminated” or “dirty” (according to my intrusive thoughts), it had to be thrown out. At my most challenging point with OCD, these obsessions inadvertently led me to lose over 100 lbs. ",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,93,5
1851,"Then there was the “what if I accidentally poisoned everyone I love most” stage where everything had to be thrown away if I had the slightest thought that I could have had something on my hands that was transferred to the food. For far too many years, I was terrified of poinsettias, of all things. I had heard that they were poisonous and had developed the idea that the dust from these could cause mass casualties. At that time, I was in the trenches of this disorder—I knew it wasn’t logical, and yet the what-ifs were too great. ",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,98,5
1852,"My contamination obsessions also went beyond food. I cannot begin to tell you how many items in my lifetime I have thrown away or given away due to fears they were contaminated. These were often things I cherished. I tried to keep them at first, but my cleaning rituals became too exhausting to keep up with, so I began to discard items. Thankfully, in my youth, my mother had caught on to this and began regularly going through my garbage and saving items she knew I would later regret having thrown out. ",p,The excessive costs and excessive waste,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,92,6

This often occurs when they are in the middle of their day-to-day shopping and an intrusive thought or image comes into their mind. They may then purchase the items connected to that thought; for example, one member would have a recurring thought about canned goods becoming unsealed and would have to buy every can that she saw whenever she had this thought. She feared that if she left the can available for others to purchase, she would be irresponsible because someone else may buy it and would unknowingly eat food that was somehow tampered with.

Although she attempted to avoid most things when she went into a store, she was naturally unable to avoid every single thing and found herself accidentally brushing up against items and having to buy them. She had several piles of clothing and items with the tags still on them when we met for therapy the first time. She reported that she couldn’t bring herself to return the items due to her thoughts. Purchasing these items reassured her that no one else would have them, so no one else would be contaminated with whatever germs she may have unintentionally left on the items.",p,The financial cost of reassurance seeking,/blog/what-ocd-cost-me,140,6

She feared that she may have somehow touched that specific item and may have contaminated it, which meant someone else would get ahold of it and therefore could potentially become ill. She was compelled to go and either purchase the item or dispose of it entirely.

If so, I would encourage you to be intentional in developing a routine, as this can help signal to your brain that it’s time for bed, resulting in better sleep over time. Some people find taking a warm bath or shower before bed to be relaxing, while others enjoy reading a good book before getting some shut-eye. Perhaps you are someone who likes to listen to soft music, or you find the sounds of nature to be restful. These are all ways for you to tell your brain that it’s time to wind down for the day.

This is one of the main symptoms of this subtype. A person without OCD may think, “I probably shouldn’t have made fun of that boy in middle school,” reflect on their feelings, and move on. For someone with real events OCD, guilt over this reflection can feel overwhelming, equivalent to committing a murder. Their OCD will take hold of past events and warp them until they are a villain who can never be excused. Even if the person dismisses these thoughts in their mind with rational explanations of their innocence (e.g. everyone makes mistakes when they are growing up), the OCD will morph to find even more reasons they are guilty.",,Real Event OCD symptoms,/blog/real-events-ocd,133,10

These compulsions can take many forms but frequently include time-consuming behaviors such as spending hours thinking about or researching these thoughts and questions in order to find answers. Other common compulsions related to existential OCD involve seeking reassurance from others that you are real or that they are real, evaluating past experiences for information to prove or disprove an obsessive thought or engaging in actions that may offer physical clues of existence, such as checking for your reflection in the mirror. The problem with all of these compulsive behaviors is that their aim is to find concrete answers to questions that do not have any. This leaves individuals constantly searching for answers that they may accept for a brief period of time — only to begin doubting them again and searching for new ones. ",p,What is existential OCD?,/blog/what-is-existential-ocd-and-how-do-i-treat-it,192,8

2175,"Although it may be difficult to identify at first, the only real difference between existential OCD and any other form of the disorder is the nature of the intrusive thoughts. As such, the recommended treatment for existential related OCD remains the same as for any other variety of OCD:  Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that has been referred to as the gold standard approach for treating OCD. ERP therapy requires clients to lean into uncomfortable thoughts without engaging in compulsions to learn to tolerate uncertainty.  The goal is that through repeated exposure to the feared thoughts or stimuli the individual will begin to develop a tolerance toward the negative feelings associated with those thoughts (e.g., anxiety). It’s important to note that while the work of ERP can be uncomfortable, every step of the process is a fully agreed upon collaboration between therapist and patient. ERP never starts with the most intrusive thoughts but rather a patient starts with thoughts that land in the middle to the lower end of the hierarchy and as a patient gets more comfortable they work to tackle more difficult thoughts. ",p,Treatment for existential OCD,/blog/what-is-existential-ocd-and-how-do-i-treat-it,193,9
2176,"It is also common for individuals in ERP treatment to receive homework assignments. For someone with existential OCD, these assignments may involve reading articles or watching videos that validate or trigger the obsessive thoughts, repeatedly writing notes about the feared thoughts or creating and replaying audio recordings that confirm the thoughts. This intentional exposure to one’s obsessive thoughts can be extremely challenging and frightening, and should always be done with the help of a licensed and trained therapist. However, the “response prevention” part of ERP requires that individuals not turn to their usual compulsions such as analyzing, questioning, seeking reassurance or avoidance. Rather, the individual is gradually exposed to the feared existential thoughts through different means such as articles, books and videos. Over time, the more the individual is confronted with their feared existential thoughts while withholding from engaging in compulsive responses, the less feared those thoughts may become. ",p,Treatment for existential OCD,/blog/what-is-existential-ocd-and-how-do-i-treat-it,149,7

Instead of reassuring you, they will work with you to better tolerate the uncertainty that comes along with touching the doorknob.

2241,I’m Autistic With OCD. Here’s How My Therapist And I Made ERP Work For Me,h1,title,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,15,2
2242,"This article uses identity-first language (“autistic person”) over the more common person-first language (“person with autism”), in accordance with the preferences of the autistic community.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,25,2
2243,"When I finally got access to exposure and response prevention (ERP), thirty years after my OCD started, I was ready for it. I wasn’t scared of exposures causing distress, because I was already in distress. Why not try being in distress for a good reason? If ERP was my escape rope, I was willing to endure a little rope burn. But what I was scared about was my autism.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,69,5
2244,"Let’s be clear: I’m incredibly proud to be autistic. Autism isn’t a disorder, it’s a neurotype, just as valid and important as any other. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t come with challenges—it’s just that most of those challenges are due to how society treats us. And unfortunately, mental health professionals are often trained to see autism in a very different light to mine.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,63,5
2245,"So I was scared that my ERP therapist wouldn’t know anything about autism, or that they would think they knew about autism, but that everything they knew would be harmfully wrong. The more I ruminated about it, the more new fears would come into play. What if they tried to use ABA on me? (Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA, is a common intervention for autistic children, and my childhood experiences of it were deeply traumatizing.) What if ERP didn’t work on me because I was autistic? Some studies have found CBT is less effective for us. What if, what if, what if?",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,102,5
2246,"Luckily, I knew enough about OCD to identify these thoughts for what they were. I chose to sit with the uncertainty and do ERP anyway, and I’m glad I did, because it saved my life. But even though those fears were unfounded, ERP did still end up looking a bit different for me. It took time and experimentation for my therapist and me to find ways of doing ERP that worked with my neurotype, not against it. This is far from an exhaustive list, but here’s what some of those adaptations looked like:",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,93,5
2247,"1. One of my fears was correct: my therapist didn’t know much about autism. But in the end that didn’t matter: what mattered was they were willing to learn. I deferred to them as the expert on OCD, and they deferred to me as the expert on autism. By collaborating on the autism/OCD aspects of my treatment, we were able to pool our knowledge and come up with creative solutions. I didn’t need my therapist to be an autism expert—I just needed them to be neurodiversity-affirming and willing to both lead and listen.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,93,7
2248,"2. An important part of my ERP was making it feel mine. By incorporating my special interests and the language I used around OCD, my therapist helped me feel invested in therapy. If I came up with a metaphor I liked, they would make it part of their regular vocabulary. When I needed help regulating, they would ask me about my special interests. (Nothing calms me down faster than ranting about my passions.) I have a RuPaul’s Drag Race SUDS scale, and a whole theory about how Hamilton is a metaphor for OCD. All this personalization helped me stay motivated, but it also leveraged my autistic strengths in the service of my ERP journey.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,114,9
2249,"3. Sensory issues were a challenge. It’s hard to sit with a perfectionism exposure when your cat howls outside and suddenly your brain has short-circuited and you’re sobbing uncontrollably. It didn’t help that my OCD tends to latch on to sensory issues. Autistic sensory sensitivities don’t habituate, making sensory exposures painful and useless, but I still had to address my OCD around them. To minimize meltdowns, my therapist directed me to take a step back from exposures if sensory overload got too high, take a moment to do some sensory regulation (stimming, etc.), and then go back into the exposure. As I went through ERP, my overall stress and anxiety went down, which made sensory disruptions less frequent. ",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,118,9
2250,"4. Speaking of stimming (self-stimulatory behavior like hand flapping, rocking, or leg jiggling): stimming is NOT a compulsion, it’s a healthy regulatory behavior, but it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference. (Pro tip: if you can substitute a repetitive behavior for another one without added anxiety, it’s probably a stim. If your brain insists you have to do this one specific behavior or else, it’s probably a compulsion.) My therapist and I took time early on to discuss my preferred stims and when to use them, which helped me use stims effectively during ERP and allowed my therapist to prompt me to stim when appropriate.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,107,6
2251,"5. One fear that lingered was that ERP wouldn’t work for me because I was autistic. The main solution for that, of course, was exposures! But it also helped to learn that autistic people in ERP often benefit from behavioral approaches. Hearing this might have been a red flag—autistic people get subjected to a lot of harmful behaviorism—had it not been my exact experience. It turned out I found hands-on exposures much more effective than imaginal exposures or things like CBT charts. Recognizing that helped my therapist and I focus on the exposures that worked best for me.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,98,7
2252,"6. The other fear that lingered was that I wouldn’t always be able to tell what was my autism and what was OCD. A lot of autistic behaviors resemble OCD, but they happen for completely different reasons, and I was scared of approaching something the wrong way and making it worse. My therapist encouraged me to sit with the uncertainty and resist the urge to figure out exactly what was what. They said I didn’t always need to know for sure to experiment and find solutions—and by and large, they were right. This question comes up a lot in the NOCD Autism & OCD support group that I co-run, and I always tell them the same thing.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,117,7
2253,"7. Finally, it was really helpful to recognize just how much of my OCD was related to my autism. Perfectionism around masking, social interactions, or regulating executive dysfunction; moral scrupulosity latching onto my autistic sense of justice; health anxiety about my sensory sensitivities. ERP helped me realize that for most of my life, I had been using OCD as a maladaptive coping mechanism to survive in a hostile world, and knowing that meant I could shake off my reliance on OCD and start practicing healthier skills.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,86,5
2254,"I went into ERP feeling very alone. Despite an estimated 17% of autistic people having OCD, there’s very little information and support out there for the intersection. I am privileged to have the knowledge and background to teach therapists about my neurotype, but people shouldn’t have to be able to do that to get care. That’s why I’m so grateful to be able to work with NOCD in increasing understanding and services for this neglected community. One of the great joys of my recovery (and yes, ERP worked, I’m in recovery! You can read more of my story here)  is being able to advocate for autistic people with OCD in ways that make all of us a little less alone.",p,,/blog/im-autistic-with-ocd-heres-how-my-therapist-and-i-made-erp-work-for-me,120,6
2255,"What is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and does it work for OCD?",h1,title,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,11,1
2256,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an umbrella term that is often used as a “catch-all” phrase attributed to many forms of therapy. For example, many traditional talk therapists will state that they utilize CBT as their primary treatment model. But what does CBT mean really? ",p,,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,45,3
2257,"At its core, CBT is a short-term and goal-oriented treatment involving techniques that focus on changing unhelpful behaviors and thoughts, with a heavy focus on practicing skills in between sessions as “homework.” One of the core foundational principles of CBT is that the way we think and feel impacts how we respond or behave, so it helps the people seeking treatment take a non-judgmental view of their thoughts. In other words, CBT’s approach is that if we can change the way we think about something, we can change the way it makes us feel. Through awareness of these patterns of thinking, we can make the necessary changes in our lives to function more effectively. ",p,,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,114,5
2258,"What’s important to note here is that CBT is not a singular therapy, but rather multiple therapies. CBT is a broad term that basically indicates that a therapist works with the understanding of (or that the intervention directly targets) the relationship among behaviors thoughts, and emotions. Due to that, a therapist who says they practice CBT may also be referencing their general approach to treatment, perhaps using related interventions such as challenging thoughts, providing encouragement, and processing events. In these cases, the therapist may not be using evidence-based treatments, but rather may be providing unstructured therapy that allows the client to guide the session–this can be detrimental in the treatment of some conditions, like OCD. ",p,,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,115,5
2259,"That’s why when you find a therapist who mentions they practice CBT, we recommend that you ask more questions to understand the type of CBT they are trained in, and whether that specific therapy they’re trained in under the CBT umbrella is the best or right therapy to treat the condition(s) you’re seeking care for. For example, the clinically effective and recommended treatment for OCD is a specific type of CBT called exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. ",p,,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,78,3

2261,Some of the more popularly used CBT treatments include the following: ,p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,11,1
2262,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): This is an action-oriented form of treatment in which the therapist guides the patient to accept instead of avoiding feelings and situations that are distressing and often uncontrollable. By accepting these things and committing to changing one’s behavior, one can continue to move towards valued life activities. ACT teaches that despite how a person feels in the moment, they can still choose to behave based on what they value in the long term. Mindfulness is also a key component in ACT: This helps with accepting problems as they arise without feeling the need to intervene or take control. It is also about giving yourself compassion, especially concerning one’s relationship with difficult experiences.",p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,117,6
2263,"Motivational Interviewing (MI): This type of treatment is often utilized in the early stages of therapy. The goal of MI is to assist the individual in developing awareness of ambivalence surrounding areas of behaviors that have been hard to change. This is often used to help the person get to a place where they are more ready to participate in a structured form of therapy. Behaviors that are practiced for long periods can be incredibly difficult to change. Through acknowledging and addressing barriers to change, one can become more ready to face the challenges of change.",p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,96,6
2264,"Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT): This treatment focuses on the development of core skills that include emotion regulation, distress tolerance, mindfulness, and stress reduction. DBT also works to reduce self-destructive behaviors. When someone is experiencing intense emotional distress, it can be hard to remain in the moment. Mindfulness skills can help a person stay grounded during times of deep emotional turmoil. By pausing and paying attention to one’s surroundings and senses, an individual can slow down and be present in the moment. By remaining non-judgemental about the experience, and not engaging in automatic negative thinking and behavior patterns, individuals learn to use healthy coping skills. ",p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,104,7
2265,"Distress tolerance in DBT involves the acceptance of who one is, as well as acceptance of one’s experience. Distraction, self-soothing behaviors, and seeing things from a more positive outlook can help a person who is struggling to remain in control of situations as they arise. Another key component of DBT is interpersonal effectiveness. DBT teaches skills to help people be assertive and get their needs met in relationships. DBT also teaches skills of emotional regulation by helping a person to channel their emotions in a manner through learning to accurately identify their feelings and tolerate them. Through acceptance and change, people can begin to respond differently to their experiences. ",p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,109,7
2266,"Behavioral Activation: This can be a stand-alone treatment or is sometimes labeled as a skill of CBT. Behavioral activation is based on the belief that action precedes emotion; in other words, how you act will determine how you feel. This is a very effective treatment for depression. Through increasing positive reinforcement of behaviors, we can increase the probability of that behavior continuing. By learning to replace negative behaviors with more positive ones, a person can reduce feelings of depression.",p,Different forms of treatment that interweave CBT skills,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,79,6

2268,"Specialists trained in OCD treatment will not provide traditional “talk therapy,” as it can be unstructured, ritualistic, and does not include an emphasis on behavioral change, which is central to OCD recovery. Rather, they should be practicing very distinct types of CBT that were designed and work specifically for OCD and related disorders, such as hoarding disorder, tic disorders, and body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). ",p,The treatments for OCD and related conditions are specialized forms of CBT,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,64,3

2270,"Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP): A specific type of CBT intervention used to treat OCD, and considered the gold standard treatment for OCD. ERP is a specialized treatment that has been clinically proven to work in treating OCD. Exposures involve exposing oneself to the thoughts, images, triggers, situations, objects, or urges that evoke anxiety and distress. These often surround the intrusive thoughts that someone is experiencing. Response prevention refers to not engaging in the compulsions that are typically done in response to the anxiety and distress that comes from obsessions. Sometimes these compulsions are mental, meaning they cannot be seen by someone else, but they are happening in the mind of individuals with OCD. Other compulsions may be physical or noticeable by others. ",p,The treatments for OCD and related conditions are specialized forms of CBT,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,123,8
2271,"One of the most important parts of ERP treatment is helping the person not to engage in the typical rituals, and to instead not respond to unwanted thoughts, images, or urges. This process of being triggered and then resisting the urge to complete a compulsion works to help the person learn that they can tolerate distress. It provides long-term relief of symptoms versus the short-term anxiety relief of completing a compulsion. This process also allows the brain to learn that the thoughts are not actually threats or dangerous; they are just thoughts.",p,The treatments for OCD and related conditions are specialized forms of CBT,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,92,5
2272,"Habit Reversal Training (HRT): This is an effective form of treatment that is often used to treat Trichollotomania (hair pulling), excoriation disorder or Dermatillomania (skin picking), and other BFRBs. HRT is also an effective treatment for tic disorders, such as Tourette’s disorder. HRT works first by providing awareness training, allowing the individual to become more in tune with when, where, and how a particular behavior impacts them. By noticing the thoughts or situations that lead to the behavior, we can better predict when it will occur in the future. This is important for the prevention of the behaviors. ",p,The treatments for OCD and related conditions are specialized forms of CBT,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,98,6
2273,"Once the person has developed a good sense of when these behaviors are more likely to occur, they are guided in developing a competing response. A competing response is an action that prevents the undesired behavior. Individuals are then tasked with practicing the competing response outside of sessions. Motivation to continue using the competing response is also worked on, encouraging the individual to remember why they stopped the original behavior in the first place. Then the individual begins to generalize the new behaviors into their daily life for long-term success. The involvement of a person’s support network is also another critical component of HRT.",p,The treatments for OCD and related conditions are specialized forms of CBT,/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-does-it-work-for-ocd,104,7

2275,"What can be confusing is that you might see the term CBT thrown around in reference to ERP and wonder if they’re interchangeable terms. After all, CBT treatments involve working with a therapist to address and change both thinking and behavioral patterns, making it a popular form of psychotherapy designed to help people learn how to cope with problems in order to reduce—or eliminate—symptoms.

Often, therapists will take elements from more than one form of treatment and interweave them in a way that makes sense for the individual. Each person presents with different needs, so having an individualized treatment plan will work to address these varying concerns.

Avenues of creative expression can be vast. There are no right ways to do it. ,p,,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,45,6
2287,"That’s the beauty of using creative interventions in treatment, too: they allow you to identify what may be most helpful specifically to you in your healing journey. With OCD treatment, creativity can be a therapeutic intervention, allowing people to work through their intrusive thoughts and compulsions through creative or artistic media. ",p,,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,51,3

2289,"Creativity isn’t about the end result. It’s about the expression and the process. It’s the messy part where the hidden work lies. The hard work of trying to heal from what is causing the pain, or at least to be able to manage it effectively. This will look different for each person, and it requires vulnerability. ",p,Vulnerability is a key component,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,56,6
2290,"What does it mean to be vulnerable? It’s to invite uncertainty, which lies at the core of OCD. To be open to the potential of judgment from others, which can be a terrifying experience for people with OCD. OCD doesn’t want you to learn to lean into the anxiety and discomfort that intrusive thoughts inevitably bring about. This keeps you in a constant state of avoidance where you steer clear of anything that feels difficult or uncomfortable. It’s a trick that keeps you trapped in a cycle of thinking you are alone and that no one else feels like you do. ",p,Vulnerability is a key component,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,101,6
2291,"Being creative in any form requires surrendering to vulnerability. With any mental illness or condition, people often feel unheard, unseen, and unimportant. Through creativity, you can feel heard, seen, and validated—maybe for the first time—and this can be life-changing. ",p,Vulnerability is a key component,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,39,4

2293,"Leaning into vulnerability to share your truth takes courage, but you can speak your truth in the way that feels best to you, whatever it may be. For some it might look like painting, drawing, or poetry; for others it could be sharing inspirational sayings and encouraging others. It can be completely unique: I once worked with someone who enjoyed making art from legos, and another who loved creating artwork from crayons alone. ",p,Why is creative work important?,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,73,4
2294,"Remember that OCD will try and get you to keep your feelings and thoughts inside, for fear of how others may respond. OCD knows that when you open up about thoughts and urges, you take away their power. To be vulnerable and express yourself is to battle with OCD. ",p,Why is creative work important?,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,49,4
2295,"Expressing yourself creatively can also help you learn self-compassion. You allow yourself to acknowledge that you are struggling. You can start the process of letting go of what OCD says you are, and explore the things you value most through self-expression. When someone leans into vulnerability and is creative, they choose to reveal very deep parts of themselves. Ask yourself: are you truly ready to share those very secret parts of yourself? ",p,Why is creative work important?,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,72,5
2296,"There can be freedom in sharing these emotions and feelings, even when others don’t understand what you’re trying to say. People can always misinterpret and can often only see things from their own point of view, and that’s okay. It’s your story to tell. It’s your truth. ",p,Why is creative work important?,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,47,5

2298,"The use of creative interventions within exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy can aid treatment for people with OCD. ERP teaches you to sit with uncertainty and to lean into anxiety and discomfort, and to hold your values over your fears. Creativity in ERP allows you to express yourself and your values in the truest way. The goal of using creative strategies is to increase your awareness and identify your strengths and abilities. ",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,73,5
2299,"Through creativity, a person can become vulnerable and share things that they may have not otherwise shared. In ERP, creative interventions can provide unique ways to face triggers, finding a delicate balance between addressing core fears and working with what someone is willing to face at a specific point in their treatment process. ",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,53,3
2300,"Using creativity in exposures can make a real difference. I have found that some of the most creative exposures come from members themselves, and that these exposures can be the most impactful and effective. This is because, through their own vulnerability, they are choosing to face something they previously thought they couldn’t. ",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,52,4
2301,"While working on ERP with several artists or creatives, it can be helpful to use a member’s core fear as the subject for an imaginal exposure. For example, someone working with a fear of knives may benefit from making a sculpture incorporating their intrusive images as a form of exposure. One time, while I worked with a poet, they wrote a poem on the fear of never being left alone. It repeated a phrase: “I’m not certain anymore.”",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,78,5
2302,"Others with OCD may experience a theme of perfectionism, or feeling like things need to be “just right.” The beautiful thing about any creative expression is that it cannot be perfect; by nature it is imperfect and incomplete. That’s what makes it honest. It takes a tremendous amount of bravery to say, “I am no longer going to let this thought, image, urge, or feeling control my life.” To live the life you want, in spite of what OCD tells you. ",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,81,6
2303,"For members working with a NOCD therapist, NOCD offers a support group that is based on incorporating creativity into OCD treatment. The support group usually begins with a prompt, which can be anything that requires you to embrace an unknown outcome. Keeping in mind that OCD causes many to seek perfection, the support group encourages an environment of experimentation, steering away from perfectionism entirely.  The support group is free to NOCD members currently working with a therapist, and takes place every week.",p,How to incorporate creative interventions while doing ERP,/blog/creative-interventions-while-doing-erp,82,5

2333,"One way to distinguish between the suicidal OCD subtype and actual suicidal intent is that in suicidal OCD the person fears wishes surrounding, thinking about, or imagines taking their own life. They do not wish to actually end their life. They fear having that wish and they fear they will somehow lose control of their mind and go ahead with whatever plan would result in death. ",p,,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,66,4

But where OCD has taken hold of someone’s psyche, the person will worry and obsess over these thoughts, images or urges, fearing that they might actually be suicidal and that they may act on these urges. As a result, they can go to extreme lengths with behavioral and mental compulsions to avoid their feared outcomes just to release the anxiety they’re feeling due to their obsessions.",p,,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,114,4

2336,"Like any other OCD type or subtype, suicidal OCD is best treated with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. In ERP, we expose a person to the fears their obsessions have attached to, while discouraging the use of any mental or behavioral compulsions. By doing this, the person learns that there is no risk to start with, and therefore doing compulsions is an exercise in futility. They also learn that either their distress will reduce on its own without doing the compulsions, or, alternatively, that they are able to tolerate the distress at any level without actually having to undertake any rituals or compulsions.                                                                                                                                                                    ",p,EXPOSURES FOR SUICIDAL OCD,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,104,5

Obsessing over these thoughts or urges causes distress, so they may decide to change their route to avoid crossing the bridge. Avoidance is a behavioral compulsion. If the person has no other alternative to crossing the bridge, they might do it while engaging in other compulsions, such as praying or counting. ",,EXPOSURES FOR SUICIDAL OCD,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,86,6

They may use avoidance as a compulsion, staying away from knives or other sharp objects. If they have to use a sharp object, they make sure they are never alone, which itself becomes another compulsion. In ERP, we would have this person practice chopping vegetables with a knife while alone at home. Again, by resisting the compulsion and practicing the trigger, they see that they are able to survive the distressing thoughts, and those thoughts may even lessen over time.",p,EXAMPLES OF SUICIDAL OCD EXPOSURES,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,102,6
2343,"Yet another example would be someone who worries they will feel so sad, sick, and tired that they will lose control and overdose on a bottle of pills. This person might add extra safety measures to administering medications, such as keeping their pill bottles in a locked safe or locking the medicine cabinet. They might even make sure that they have no personal access to medicines, instead asking a family member if they need to take a pill. An exposure in this case would be to leave a pill in an unlocked medicine cabinet easily accessed by them. The person sits with the anxiety of knowing this, without using any compulsions such as reassurance seeking from the therapist or a family member that they won’t overdose on the pill. Over time they can leave more pills in the bottle as an ERP exercise. With time and practice, they learn to live with the discomfort of the obsession, and it loses its power over them.",,EXAMPLES OF SUICIDAL OCD EXPOSURES,/blog/what-are-suicidal-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,164,8

This is often done in a compulsive manner, to ensure that they have not inadvertently offended someone or embarrassed themselves. ",p,,/blog/people-pleasing-patterns-in-ocd,66,4
2348,"Another key component of OCD is the mistrust one has of themselves and who one is at their core.

This can be maladaptive, or counterproductive, because this agreeableness may primarily come from a fear of disapproval.

2412,"People with SO-OCD experience intrusive thoughts and urges around denial of or confusion about their true sexual orientation. Someone with SO-OCD will experience fears around being perceived as “gay” or “straight.” They might wonder if they actually are an orientation other than the one they thought. They may fear they are in denial of their sexual orientation. Or, they might worry that they may “turn” gay or straight, and what it will mean for their life. Will they have to leave their family? Will their relationship end when they discover they are not who they think they are?",p,What is SO-OCD?,/blog/is-hocd-same-as-so-ocd,98,6
2413,"A person with SO-OCD might analyze their own actions very diligently and be excessively concerned with whether or not their behaviors align them with a particular sexual orientation. “Why did I look at that guy at the gym? What does it mean that I think this woman is attractive? What if I’m actually straight and am not really in love with my partner?” These thoughts can take hold of a person’s mind and not let go until they’ve found sufficient proof that these fears are unfounded. However, as with all types of OCD, the relief is only temporary, and it’s only a matter of time before the cycle begins again. ",p,What is SO-OCD?,/blog/is-hocd-same-as-so-ocd,110,4
2414,"In order to ease the stress of these intrusive thoughts, someone with SO-OCD will often engage in compulsions. A common one is seeking reassurance. This will look like asking people in their life to reaffirm their sexual orientation. “Do you think I’m gay? But do you think my behaviors might mean I am? Are you sure?” No matter how many times a friend or family member reassures you, however, it’s only a matter of time before the obsessions start up again. Because sexual orientation plays such a big part of a person’s life and identity, and because OCD tends to latch on to what an individual values, it can feel like there is endless fuel for these intrusive thoughts and anxieties. ",,What is SO-OCD?,/blog/is-hocd-same-as-so-ocd,121,6

It’s important to note that having this condition isn’t actually about one’s sexual orientation, but the sense of doubt that’s common among all subtypes of OCD. Therapists report that patients with SO-OCD are not concerned with which orientation fits them, but just want to be 100% certain they know what their sexual orientation is. They might say, “I don’t even care if I’m gay or straight; I just want to know for sure.” For this reason, people of any sexual orientation can have SO-OCD, because it’s not about their actual identity, but rather the uncertainty that exists for everyone as part of human nature.",p,What is SO-OCD?,/blog/is-hocd-same-as-so-ocd,121,6

Instead of engaging in mental tracking about your response to the photo might mean about your sexual orientation, you’ll work with the therapist to sit with this discomfort. At first it can feel excruciating to have to sit with stressful thoughts without trying to make them go away. But with practice, the intrusive thoughts will have less and less significance.

2444,"For people with Scrupulosity OCD, ERP therapy might include exposure to a trigger that is connected to the patient’s urge to seek reassurance. For instance, take Eric (the character from the first example, who felt guilty about finding scripture funny). One of his compulsions was to repeatedly, excessively go to confession to seek reassurance from his priest that he hadn’t blasphemed and was not going to go to hell. An ERP exercise might involve Eric thinking about a time he had an inappropriate reaction to scripture. His therapist would then help him avoid his compulsive urge to seek out reassurance through confession. Eventually, his obsessions and compulsive behavior would improve as he learns to stop relying on compulsions to relieve his anxiety in the short term.  ",,What are the Treatment Options for Scrupulosity (or Religious) OCD?,/blog/scrupulosity-religious-ocd-symptoms-treatment,126,7
2445,"Sometimes people with Scrupulosity OCD are concerned about being asked to actually sin or go against their moral values during ERP. This is contrary to one of the goals of ERP, which is to help people with Scrupulosity OCD be able to engage in activities that are important. A trained ERP therapist wants you to be able to live within your values, not lead a life dictated by Scrupulosity OCD. ",p,What are the Treatment Options for Scrupulosity (or Religious) OCD?,/blog/scrupulosity-religious-ocd-symptoms-treatment,70,4

2453,"Emotional contamination in OCD can be difficult to recognize. It involves a fear that certain people, places, or objects are contaminated, which leads the person affected to believe that they must be avoided or that rituals are needed to avoid negative outcomes. These individuals are not necessarily perceiving “contamination” in a traditional, physical sense, but rather as an inward emotional or mental contamination. ",p,What is emotional contamination OCD?,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,63,4
2454,"For example, they may not have had contact with a physical external contaminant, but rather a taboo thought or one involving what they believe is a moral impurity. They may believe that having these thoughts will contaminate what’s around them. This can also lead them to feel “dirty” or “evil” and to attribute this feeling to an object, situation, or even a person. ",p,What is emotional contamination OCD?,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,63,4

2456,"Though the feelings are internal, someone who is experiencing emotional contamination fears may try to physically “wash away” these intrusive thoughts. They may feel that if they do not wash outwardly, there’s a chance that the thoughts may be true. Their need for uncertainty keeps the OCD cycle going, and can lead to hours of hand-washing, chapped hands, endless showers, and rewashing laundry. It leaves the person with OCD trapped in a cycle of compulsions that only strengthen the idea that there was a real danger. ",p,How emotional contamination manifests,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,86,5
2457,"Others may instead attempt to deal with emotional contamination by spending countless hours in prayer and confession, trying to feel “clean.” They may seek constant reassurance that they are not a bad person. The relief that they feel from any reassurance they receive is short-lived, though, and only reinforces the idea that they cannot rely on their own sense of self or feelings, because they doubt on a deep level who they are and what they are capable of. ",p,How emotional contamination manifests,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,79,4
2458,"OCD can be extremely creative. Sometimes the meaning or feeling that emotional contamination creates is attached to a characteristic or a situation. An example of this would be a person who has come into contact with someone who has cheated on their partner, then later has an intrusive thought that they too could cheat on their own partner. They become tormented by these intrusive and unwanted thoughts. As a result, they begin avoiding any possible contact with anyone who has ever cheated on their partner. They may even avoid watching all TV shows that depict cheating or unfaithfulness. ",p,How emotional contamination manifests,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,98,7

This affected her most while she was eating – if she had a thought she considered “impure,” she began to feel that what she was eating would then become contaminated. She could no longer finish it because in her mind, it was now “dirty.”",p,"Attaching feelings of contamination to objects, people, places, and more ",/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,92,5

This led her to feel so ashamed and sickened that she could no longer eat red foods, despite rationally knowing there was no blood. Just the possibility of eating the food could make it somehow true that she had harmed someone, and this caused her enough anxiety that she felt she had to avoid it.",p,"Attaching feelings of contamination to objects, people, places, and more ",/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,94,5

He would then immediately change his clothes in an attempt to prevent this, and he would avoid any of the clothing he had been wearing each time he had those thoughts. He would never wear them again. Before he knew it, John had very few items of clothing that felt safe to wear. ",p,"Attaching feelings of contamination to objects, people, places, and more ",/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,87,5
2464,"People with emotional contamination may understand that there is no tangible relationship between the clothing they wear and whether someone will get into a car accident, or that a mental thought won’t physically contaminate their food. But the familiar whisper of OCD that says “just in case” or “but what if” becomes the driving force, creating doubt and fear that lead to compulsions and sometimes extreme avoidance. ",p,"Attaching feelings of contamination to objects, people, places, and more ",/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,67,3
2465,"Engaging in rituals or compulsions to try and neutralize these thoughts may feel good in the moment, but that feeling doesn’t last for long. The thoughts will keep coming back until they are faced head-on. To combat these unwanted thoughts, the individual with OCD must decide that they will not engage in the compulsion and see what will happen. That’s the only way that the brain can learn that there is no real danger or real connection between the feared thought and the resulting behavior. ",p,"Attaching feelings of contamination to objects, people, places, and more ",/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,85,5

Magical thinking is very prevalent in people with OCD, particularly in children with OCD. ",p,Engaging in magical thinking ,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,55,5

The child will have a need to say certain words or prayers the same way each time, or they may say it a specific number of times or repeatedly until it feels “just right.” They may say it in their head, but because OCD causes doubt, they’ll question themselves. This will often lead them to restart the whole process again, which can result in endless amounts of time being spent on this compulsion. ",p,Engaging in magical thinking ,/blog/what-is-emotional-contamination-in-ocd,105,5

2487,"Sexual orientation OCD (SO-OCD) is a subtype of OCD that is characterized by intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors around a person’s sexual orientation. It has been referred to as homosexual OCD (H-OCD); however, this term is increasingly discouraged due to its lack of sensitivity. People with SO-OCD experience intrusive thoughts and urges around denial of or confusion about their true sexual orientation. Someone with SO-OCD may experience fears around being perceived as having a certain sexual orientation, such as gay or straight. They might wonder if they have a sexual orientation other than the one they thought. They may fear they are in denial of their “true” sexual orientation. Or, they might fear that their sexual orientation could abruptly change (e.g., “turn” gay or straight) and what this change will mean for their life. (Will they have to leave their family? Will their relationship end when they discover they are not who they think they are?) ",p,Sexual orientation OCD symptoms ,/blog/what-is-sexual-orientation-ocd-so-ocd-your-guide-to-this-ocd-subtype,156,10
2488,"A person with SO-OCD might analyze their own behaviors very diligently and be excessively concerned with whether their behaviors align them with a particular sexual orientation (“Why did I look at that guy at the gym? What does it mean that I think this woman is attractive? What if I’m actually straight and am not really in love with my partner?”). These thoughts can take hold of a person’s mind and not let go until they’ve found sufficient proof that these fears are unfounded. However, as with all types of OCD, the relief is only temporary, and it’s only a matter of time before the cycle begins again. ",p,Sexual orientation OCD symptoms ,/blog/what-is-sexual-orientation-ocd-so-ocd-your-guide-to-this-ocd-subtype,108,4

It’s important to note that having this condition isn’t actually about one’s sexual orientation, but the sense of doubt that’s common among all subtypes of OCD. Therapists report that patients with SO-OCD are sometimes not concerned with which orientation fits them but just want to be 100% certain they know what their sexual orientation is.

2495,"The best course of treatment for SO-OCD, like all types of OCD, is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. The idea behind ERP is that repeated exposure to obsessive thoughts without engaging in compulsions is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually reach out for the compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage in them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. ",p,Sexual orientation OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-sexual-orientation-ocd-so-ocd-your-guide-to-this-ocd-subtype,91,5

As part of ERP therapy, you will track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of how distressing each thought is. You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions.

2497,"While traditional talk therapy effectively treats different issues, it can potentially be counterproductive for SO-OCD. Here is a brief example. Say you are struggling with the idea that you could be gay and have to leave your partner. In talk therapy, you might focus on the fact that this isn’t actually true. The therapist may point out that there’s no basis for your fear of being gay, and remind you that you’ve been happily married for nine years. Although this comment may feel helpful, for someone struggling with magical thinking OCD, it may fulfill the compulsive need for reassurance.  ",,Sexual orientation OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-sexual-orientation-ocd-so-ocd-your-guide-to-this-ocd-subtype,99,7

With a therapist, you’ll work toward overcoming this compulsion so that you’re eventually able to spend time with your friend without fear.

Would you end up all alone? Would your entire social circle abandon you? Would you be exiled from your religious community? Speaking about the worst-case scenario helps you become familiar with the underlying fear driving your obsessive thoughts and compulsions, which eventually helps relieve it.

2530,"As human beings, it is only natural for us not to want to feel any pain. That’s why one of the things we often focus on when reflecting on any problem we’ve encountered is what it has cost us. We tend to want to identify what has been painful and why, because we hope to “fix” it or avoid it in the future. ",p,,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,63,4
2531,"Unfortunately, pain is an inevitable part of being human. At the same time, hope can see us through even our darkest times. I have found it helpful to take this a step further by being intentional and asking myself, “What can I learn from this situation or experience?” Often, there is something we can take away from even the most heartbreaking of circumstances. ",p,,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,63,4

Some people may feel that this could give too much credit to what caused their suffering.

2534,"As someone who has suffered from OCD since I was a very young child, it has been an integral part of my journey to identify the things that OCD taught me. Maybe these are things I would have learned without this illness, and maybe not. Regardless, throughout my journey, I have found that I am stronger than I could have ever imagined. I know that may sound cliche, but there is something about going through adversity that brings about a quiet strength. A certain type of courage is developed—one that doesn’t hold you back from new experiences. ",p,What OCD taught me,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,97,6
2535,"For me, the feeling of having experienced this disorder and coming out on the other side feels similar to giving birth. For those of you who haven’t experienced this, let me tell you what I mean: when I gave birth to my three children, it was the most physically painful experience I have ever felt, but at the same time, the most beautiful results came from it. At the time, I thought I couldn’t possibly keep going. I was exhausted, weary, and frustrated, and I wanted to throw in the towel. This was not an option, though; I had to push through. ",p,What OCD taught me,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,102,6
2536,"There are similar experiences in many people’s lives. We are given circumstances that we may not have any control over, and we are faced with choices: do we carry on, or do we give up?

2537,"Through exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, I gained the skills I needed to battle OCD. I came to understand that I do not need to attach meaning to intrusive thoughts, images, urges, or feelings. I learned that I do not need to internalize the feelings that unwanted thoughts bring into my mind. ERP taught me to lean into fear, rather than avoiding it. By taking it step-by-step, and working side-by-side with a specialist trained in OCD and ERP, I was able to develop skills that will last me a lifetime. ",p,What OCD taught me,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,91,6
2538,"As paradoxical as it may seem, when you accept the uncertainty of an intrusive thought and stop trying to run from it or figure it out, it becomes less and less present. What I (and many others I have worked with) have found is that even when a thought does come into mind, it’s so much easier not to apply meaning to it. ",p,What OCD taught me,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,63,3

Through treatment and practice, I have been able to recognize OCD when it creeps into situations. I know my triggers and no longer avoid them. I no longer feel the need to know everything with certainty. I can accept that bad, scary, and heartbreaking things can, unfortunately, happen in my life and in the lives of those that I love, and I will figure out a way through it, if and when it happens. ",p,Gaining my life and freedom back,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,107,7
2541,"Before going through ERP therapy, it felt much easier to avoid things that could bring me anxiety. If I thought there was even a possibility of having an intrusive thought in a certain setting, I would avoid it entirely. At one point, it had gotten so bad that I refused to go anywhere by myself. I was scared of being alone–-scared I would not know what was real or what wasn’t. I didn’t see a way out. I lived in a glass case of fear and felt that at any moment a thought could break it and I would lose myself. It was terrifying. ",p,Gaining my life and freedom back,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,104,8
2542,"Those who have experienced OCD might know exactly how tormenting this can feel. But there is hope. I didn’t stay in that place. Only by going through it did I start to see the other side. That taught me that when I am going through anything extremely difficult I can always remember that there is always something on the other side. So whenever I feel “stuck,” I am reminded of my OCD struggles and how I am no longer stuck there. I may have stayed in that place for many years, but I didn’t stay there forever. None of those thoughts, fears, or feelings were forever. ",p,Gaining my life and freedom back,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,106,9

2546,"I have also gained back the gift of time. OCD took so many precious memories from me and dominated my formative years. I distinctly remember being a 20-something with my whole life in front of me, and yet I wanted to be older—I wanted to be closer to death. It pains me to write that, but it’s the truth. Living with OCD was so painful that I wanted to escape it. I wanted to run from it; I didn’t see a way out. At that time, it was all-consuming, and I rarely had glimpses of a life where OCD didn’t exist. The good news is that there is hope: you can get better, and you can get to a place where you want to live. I know because I am living in that space today.

2547,"The time I lost to OCD causes me a great deal of sadness to this day, but ERP allowed me to make fresh memories and create new adventures. Now, I can see that my fight with OCD also gave me a strong sense of purpose. My struggles led me to exactly where I am, where I needed to be. Through my recovery, I have been able to look at the parts of myself that my struggles OCD.

2548,"OCD even played a part in the personality I developed. The tools I gained through therapy have helped me see that some characteristics that proved less helpful in my struggles with OCD are quite useful outside of OCD. For example, caring for others is a healthy quality, but OCD tried to make this a disadvantage by causing me to overthink many areas of my life and relationships. After going through treatment, I was able to use this positively. Rather than feeling responsible for everyone and everything, I could move towards the things I valued. I put my energy and time into things that I truly cared deeply about. ",p,The time—and happiness—I regained,/blog/how-therapy-helped-me-gain-back-all-that-ocd-had-tried-to-take,108,7

2597,"At NOCD, our core value is called “member-first”: Everything that we do as a team each day focuses on serving our community of members with OCD and related conditions. People sometimes are debilitated by the time they reach us. It’s sadly pretty common for our team to see people who have been misdiagnosed several times, suffering for over a decade, and looking at NOCD as their last hope since nothing else has worked previously. That’s why we take our member-first value very seriously. Because we’re the last hope for many, offering a “white-glove” effort is a must.",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,97,6
2598,"We’ve also learned over the years that truly offering a member-first therapy experience can only be possible if we give each NOCD Therapist incredible support. Our goal is to offer a work environment where there’s not only enough time to serve our community members, but also ample non-clinical time to reflect on how to best deliver care, participate in training to grow professionally, and balance outside of work needs. Therapists can be more efficient, effective, and do what they enjoy and they’re good at – helping members get better – when they are not overburdened by administrative tasks.  ",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,98,4
2599,"After reflecting on these learnings from scaling over the past two years, we realized there’s an opportunity to expand on our member-first commitment by taking a deeper approach to serving our community. People who go through NOCD Therapy often have life-altering results, but there are still some people who need to be referred outside of our team’s circle of influence for additional services, like medication management. ",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,66,3
2600,"The gold-standard treatment for OCD is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication. For many people, the relationship between SSRI medication and ERP therapy is somewhat analogous to the connection between a knee brace and knee surgery for people with a torn knee. After tearing a knee ligament, people often wear a brace in the short-term so that they can function throughout the day and to reduce swelling prior to their knee surgery, which is the long-term intervention. After their knee surgery, people then often do physical therapy and will use the brace on their knee for stabilization, until they can walk again without it.",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,111,5
2601,"It’s similar for SSRIs and ERP. People with OCD might use SSRIs to at least partially reduce the intensity of symptoms so that they can do ERP. Once symptoms improve because of ERP’s efficacy, their psychiatrist might lower their dosages. At this point, some people may not need medication anymore at all and can benefit from ERP alone; some may utilize this combination of SSRIs and ERP for a certain time period; and some may benefit from doing ERP and continuing taking medications for the long-term. ",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,86,5
2602,"Each individual’s situation is unique and requires appropriate clinical guidance. That’s why our team at NOCD spends a considerable amount of time referring members to psychiatric services that our members need. At times though, the referral process can be pretty strenuous for our members and operationally cumbersome for our therapist network. For example, both NOCD therapists and members have to work the processes needed to get appointments coordinated promptly, become acclimated with another practice’s processes and procedures, explain what’s wrong to the additional provider, and hope that they receive treatment as evidence-based as NOCD’s. ",p,,/blog/announcing-nocd-telepsychiatry,94,5
2603,"I’m pleased to announce that our team is committed to ending this issue for the community of people with OCD and related conditions.

A psychiatrist with specialty training in OCD best understands the right medications and the right doses that a person with OCD needs, and will ensure that medication is prescribed in the safest manner possible. One of our goals is to help people in the OCD community not be overmedicated, yet also ensure that those who are in need of medication are receiving the correct medication at the correct dose.

There is research to suggest that pedophilia OCD, an OCD subtype characterized by obsessions and compulsions around fear one might be a pedophile, is actually a fairly common subtype of OCD.",p,,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,57,3

2612,"Pedophilia OCD, or POCD, is characterized by persistent, intrusive and unwanted sexual thoughts about children and/or teens (under 18) and the resulting thought that one might be a pedophile. For example, if someone with POCD finds themselves thinking a student of theirs is attractive, their OCD might take hold of this thought and try to convince the person they are a pedophile. Everyone has intrusive thoughts from time to time, but a person with POCD will assign it meaning about who they are as a person. They might tell themselves, “If I found my student attractive, I must be a pedophile. What other explanation is there? What if I act on my thoughts next time?” ",,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,115,5
2613,"The difference is, the idea of potentially harming a child is terrifying and causes a sufferer to engage in compulsive behavior meant to alleviate this fear and prevent the feared outcome from occurring (e.g., excessive online research about what makes someone a pedophile, or avoiding children altogether). It is important to emphasize that the intrusive thoughts people with POCD experience center on the fear of being a pedophile, or doing something that could characterize them as a pedophile — and are entirely separate from pedophilia. ",p,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,85,5
2614,"While a pedophile typically takes pleasure in their sexual thoughts about children, someone with POCD is typically deeply horrified by them and will spend an exceptional amount of energy trying to make these thoughts go away. They might stop seeing their family and find themselves isolated and consumed with fear.",p,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,50,3
2615,"The best treatment option for POCD is the same as all forms of OCD: exposure and response prevention therapy, or ERP. It’s considered the first line of treatment for people with OCD. ERP therapy works to expose you to stimuli that triggers your anxiety without engaging in any compulsive behavior to neutralize the obsession. By doing this, you gradually learn that your anxiety is manageable and that the feared outcome likely does not occur. ",p,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,74,5
2616,"For someone with POCD, ERP therapy might look something like this. Let’s say a person’s POCD has led them to avoid their niece, for fear they’ll behave in such a way that would “make” them a pedophile. The idea of potentially hurting a loved one is so terrifying that the person has avoided all contact with their family. An ERP therapist would work with the person to eventually get to a place where they could spend time with their family again. The person with POCD and therapist will work together on a list of gradual exposures personalized to the obsessions and compulsions the person is experiencing. For example, the idea of speaking with their niece over the phone may still feel scary but more manageable than visiting in person. Eventually, stopping by for a few minutes to drop off a gift may feel doable.",,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,144,8
2617,"Together with their therapist, they will choose a plan of personalized gradual exposures, and will work together to process the emotions that come up during the exposures. This process may bring up many of the fears the patient has been trying to alleviate with their compulsions (e.g.: “What if I really am a pedophile and my therapist is wrong? My life will be ruined.”) However, when a person with POCD realizes their worst fears aren’t actualized through their actions, they learn they can tolerate the discomfort or anxiety driving their obsessions and compulsions. It might not happen right away, but the goal is for people to gradually get to a place where POCD no longer has a grip on their actions and lives. ",p,What is POCD and how is it treated?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,123,7

2619,"Like many issues revolving around mental health, the answer is: It depends. While the duration of treatment will vary from person to person, mental health professionals say to generally expect between 12 and 20 sessions to notice significant change or improvement. This of course depends on how an individual responds to ERP and how severe the condition is to begin with. Some people see positive results within a few sessions. For others, the course of treatment will be much longer. OCD is a condition that can’t necessarily be “cured,” but it can be treated and managed. ",p,How long does treatment take for POCD?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,96,7
2620,"One barrier to treatment for people with POCD is reaching out for support. The deep shame and disgust a person feels about their condition can make it very difficult to seek help. However, it’s worth remembering that mental health professionals who have been trained in dealing with POCD are used to hearing these thoughts and will be able to help you treat your condition effectively and without judgment. Unfortunately, we are all too aware that sometimes people encounter several therapists who are not familiar with POCD before finding the right treatment. We commend your bravery for continuing to try and recommend you specifically look for someone trained in OCD and ERP.",p,How long does treatment take for POCD?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,111,6
2621,"Another barrier to adequate POCD treatment is getting an accurate diagnosis. POCD symptoms might look different than how the media and others portray OCD. For instance, individuals with POCD might engage in more mental compulsions than behavioral compulsions. A person with POCD might spend hours trying to convince themselves that they would never hurt a minor and come up with a list of why this must be the case, but no one can tell this is happening from the outside. ",,How long does treatment take for POCD?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,80,5
2622,"Once a person is seeking treatment, however, therapists say the length of treatment isn’t affected by the specific subtype of OCD, but mainly the severity of the condition, comorbidities and how willing someone is to engage in the treatment. Some examples of comorbidities that are more common in people with OCD include: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depression, panic attacks or panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. ",p,How long does treatment take for POCD?,/blog/how-long-does-pocd-last-pedophilia-ocd-symptoms-treatment,66,3
2623,"ERP therapy has been found to be 80% effective, but it can be difficult. It requires willingness on behalf of the patient to feel discomfort and engage in exercises outside of therapy sessions. This can take time to develop, and a trained therapist can help you find the motivation you need to do the work.

Suicidal OCD is a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that causes unwanted thoughts of suicide or fear of killing oneself, and it is closely tied to harm OCD.

Suicidal obsession refers to unwanted or egodystonic thoughts about suicide. People with Suicidal OCD often experience thoughts about suicide that they don’t feel they can control and that don’t align with their values. They don’t want these thoughts — in fact, it’s quite the opposite. That’s actually a hallmark sign of OCD: unwanted thoughts. However, obsessions and anxieties bring these thoughts to the surface, and those with OCD have to work harder than most to push those thoughts out. ",p,Suicidal obsessions vs. suicidal ideation,/blog/suicidal-ocd-erp-therapy-suicidal-ideation,95,7
2631,"Suicidal ideation, however, is different from suicidal obsession. Suicidal ideation refers to considering or planning to to commit suicide. Someone experiencing suicidal ideation is often voluntarily thinking about ending their life rather than having the unwanted idea of it pop into their head. These thoughts can be active — such as actively having a plan to carry it out — or passive, with a fleeting idea with no plans to carry it out. In either case, someone experiencing suicidal ideation is often brought peace by the idea of suicide rather than further distress.

It makes sense that depression might arise from fighting OCD everyday. ",p,Does OCD cause depression?,/blog/depression-ocd-how-are-they-related,110,6

2674,"Suicidal obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype that includes unwanted thoughts, images, or impulses related to killing oneself. It is closely related to harm OCD (HOCD) and is also known as harm OCD with suicidal obsessions. Suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously, which can make symptoms of suicidal OCD especially frightening and alarming. But people with suicidal OCD are not more likely to commit suicide than people with other OCD subtypes. In fact, suicidal OCD is driven by the need to protect oneself from potential self-harm. While an individual with suicidal OCD often views their intrusive and unwanted thoughts as an indication of desire to act, their compulsions are often aimed at protecting themselves from the risk of harm. Rather than seeking out opportunities to hurt themselves, they may avoid places they know will trigger suicidal thoughts or stay away from scenarios where they have a chance to cause harm to themselves.",p,Suicidal OCD symptoms,/blog/suicidal-ocd-2,154,8
2675,"Intrusive thoughts about suicide are relatively common even for people who don’t have OCD, but these thoughts generally only last a few seconds at most. For example, it’s not unusual to wonder, “What happens if I jump?” when leaning off a balcony. When this happens, people will generally think, “That was a weird thought,” and forget about it. ",p,Suicidal OCD symptoms,/blog/suicidal-ocd-2,58,4
2676,"However, most people with suicidal OCD find thoughts like these are impossible to let go of. When someone with suicidal OCD catches themselves with a thought like this, their OCD latches on and assigns meaning to it. Suddenly, the person will think, “I just had a thought that I wanted to jump. That means I do. Otherwise, why did I just think that?” These thoughts will spiral until they feel unbearable. A person might start thinking, “How could I do this to my friends and family? What will my parents think if they knew I had this thought?”",p,Suicidal OCD symptoms,/blog/suicidal-ocd-2,98,6

That may only be a couple of seconds at first. But over the weeks of treatment, it may extend to an entire minute.

In those cases, avoidance might look more like avoiding the external cues that can trigger those intrusive thoughts, like knives if you have harm OCD or kids if you have POCD.

2757,"Children often come to their caregivers first for advice or reassurance on how to deal with their problems. Parents understandably want to offer instant relief if they can see their child is distressed; as a result, they may continually reassure their child that their hands are clean or their family is safe. But reassurance can do more harm than good in the long term, as relief is short-lived and the child isn’t given the opportunity to cope independently or overcome their underlying anxiety. Furthermore, people with OCD, including children, are often not convinced by their loved one’s reassurance. In other words, the OCD causes them doubt and the cycle of anxiety and compulsions repeats itself again.",p,What can you do if you think your child has OCD? ,/blog/guide-to-children-with-ocd,116,6

At the moment when they would typically engage in one of their usual compulsive behaviors, the child is encouraged to refrain from avoidance, safety behaviors, and compulsions.

With ZOCD and other similar manifestations of OCD, the intrusive thoughts are ego-dystonic, meaning they are not representative of one’s beliefs — the person is not actually romantically attracted to animals, but they greatly fear that they might be. If you have a person who is afraid they might have or want to have sexual relations with an animal, that is more accurately called Bestiality OCD.",p,,/blog/what-is-zocd-overview-symptoms-treatment,94,4
2789,"When experiencing intrusive thoughts, it can be hard to remember that there is a difference between the thoughts and your actual desires or fantasies.

This means that ZOCD typically starts with a trigger — either internal or external — that brings about intrusive thoughts.

2920,"Regardless of how you developed OCD, it’s now considered highly treatable thanks to the emergence of treatment options like exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. A form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), ERP is considered the “gold standard” of OCD treatment, and the way it works is very simple. During ERP, you will work with the guidance of an experienced and licensed mental health professional to gain exposure to your obsessions in a safe and controlled environment. As a result, you can learn how to manage — and eventually prevent — your compulsions, giving you freedom from the endless cycle of obsessions and compulsions.",p,How is OCD treated?,/blog/are-you-born-with-ocd-can-you-develop,104,5

During the call, a team member will ask questions to learn more about your concerns and provide information for next steps and details in the appointment process. From there, NOCD will match you with a ERP-licensed therapist who can help you begin the process of treating your OCD, all within the safety and convenience of your own home.",p,How is OCD treated?,/blog/are-you-born-with-ocd-can-you-develop,84,4

Just as the struggles of a person with a medical illness may affect their family, the encouragement and support of the family in that person’s physical recovery is a critical component of their treatment. This is especially true of OCD as well.",,,/blog/erp-as-a-family-lifestyle,64,4
2924,"Consistency is key in helping a person recovering from OCD. For this reason, it is important that all family members have a clear understanding of the person’s symptoms and pain, as well as the interventions that will help – or hinder – their progress. This is not always obvious, and while family members might have the best intentions in caring for the sufferer, they may unwittingly contribute to maintaining the disorder instead of combating it.",p,,/blog/erp-as-a-family-lifestyle,75,4
2925,"An understanding of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) – the effective, evidence-based treatment for OCD – is important for family members to help their loved one recover. Further, when incorporated into the family lifestyle, rather than left only to therapy sessions, it can greatly contribute to supporting the treatment that their loved one is working through. ERP therapy can feel counter-intuitive; the things that family members may naturally want to do to help – provide reassurance, present evidence against OCD fears and doubts, submit to requests to align with the sufferer’s compulsions – may provide temporary relief but ultimately serve to feed the disorder. ",p,,/blog/erp-as-a-family-lifestyle,104,4

The sufferer is plagued by recurring doubts, unwanted images, and strong urges that drive their behavior. Often, they have terrible fears of unwanted outcomes from which they can only get relief by engaging in rituals. This is not their fault, and it is not something they feel they can stop. They are trapped in an unending cycle of “what if” thoughts that can make peace, contentment, and even basic functioning impossible for them.

Family members might naturally engage in this behavior to try to help the sufferer feel better. However, this type of response to a person’s OCD thoughts and urges maintains them; it confirms the notion that there is something that requires attention and response. Withholding reassurances and rationalizations may seem hurtful, even cruel, especially when the sufferer is desperately looking for that relief. Yet, it is critical for the family and their loved one to understand that doing so is aimed at fighting the OCD, not fighting the sufferer. If the family’s attitude and response to requests for reassurances is: “not important, no need, there is no answer or guarantee for that,” they will be asserting that there is no real threat present. Refusing to engage in their loved one’s compulsions and living life on the family’s terms, not OCD’s, will help the sufferer strip OCD of its power. ",p,"2.

Family members can be more helpful by modeling life without OCD, going about their lives naturally in confident and positive ways. This will not eliminate the sufferer’s OCD, but it will showcase how life can and should be experienced: with tolerance for uncertainty and reasonable risk.

As they work through their treatment, they are learning to respond differently to their intrusive thoughts, doubts, images, and urges. The family can help support their treatment by exhibiting belief in them – acknowledging when they are struggling but reminding them that they have a choice in how they respond. Engaging in activities and behaviors that they value as a family is helpful in highlighting that there is a much more satisfying way to go through life than chasing an illusion of safety that compulsions provide only momentarily. The family, and the sufferer, can live according to their values, what most matters to them, and thereby reinforce the notion that OCD thoughts, images, and urges are only that – unwanted perhaps, but not worthy or hijacking their behaviors and attention. When the family directs attention to living in alignment with their values, the sufferer can learn that this is possible for them, too. ",p,4.

3006,"For me, recovery was choosing to live a life that moved me towards my values. It was not basing my decisions on fears or feelings, but rather on what I knew deep down to be true. It was letting go of insecurity and doubt as much as possible and accepting things, as they were and as they are—including the “even ifs” and the “what ifs.” It was moving forward with passion and purpose towards greater goals. It was not allowing myself to be stuck in time, stuck in an endless cycle of intrusive thoughts and compulsions. It was about no longer fearing my future and all that could possibly go wrong.

3162,"The problem is, when you engage with an intrusive thought, you give it power. You tell your mind that if a thought is worth having a conversation with, it must be important and the fear must be valid. The next time you see that knife and can’t get rid of the thought, you’re likely to engage in compulsion and be back to square one.",p,,/blog/how-long-does-ocd-therapy-last,64,4

3185,"When naming your OCD, you might start by thinking about what kinds of characteristics the OCD you experience takes on. This is more than just the themes in which your OCD manifests; this is the creative power that OCD takes on in your life. For example, one person might identify that for them, OCD is overbearing, demanding, insensitive, hurtful, irrational – you get the idea. Someone else may be able to see ways in which OCD has been helpful to them at times, so they may identify characteristics like “organized” or “persistent.” ",p,Seeing OCD for what it is,/blog/can-giving-ocd-a-name-help-you-manage-it,92,5
3186,"Once you have a clear idea about the personality of your OCD symptoms, the next step is to identify a suitable name. For many, OCD is often thought of as a bully or a monster because of the pain and torment it can leave in its wake. Those people may choose to identify it by the name of an old childhood nemesis or the name of a villain from a TV show. Others may choose to give it a silly name that takes away its fear. No matter what you choose to call it, identifying it can be one way to help you in your recovery journey. ",p,Seeing OCD for what it is,/blog/can-giving-ocd-a-name-help-you-manage-it,107,6

It can be cathartic to release these thoughts outside of one’s self – to not own them as one’s own – and it’s a creative way of seeing OCD as something that you experience, not something you are. That’s an important distinction that can prevent you from internalizing the intrusive thoughts that you have and from getting stuck on them.

3190,Children who have OCD often relate well with the method of “naming the beast.” It’s a very effective way for them to see OCD for what it is: a condition that doesn’t define who they are and what they value.

3191,"When a child is struggling with OCD, their family plays an essential role in treatment, because children often lack insight into the illness. By nature, most parents want to help their child by protecting them from feelings of discomfort, leading them to enable or take part in their child’s compulsions before they even realize it. It’s easy to see why many caregivers may inadvertently accommodate the behaviors that often go hand-in-hand with OCD. ",p,How family members can work with children to name their OCD ,/blog/can-giving-ocd-a-name-help-you-manage-it,73,4
3192,"Once the family is aware of the child’s OCD and can readily identify what it is and what it isn’t, they can face this giant together. By naming it, parents can help the child identify this bully and help them to fight it, rather than giving into its unreasonable demands. They can remind the child that the more they feed it, the bigger it grows.

3202,"This happens with every single theme that OCD can latch on to. Even when you recognize and have insight into your condition, it can still have a strong pull, and the “what-ifs” can be overpowering. The reason behind this is that there is technically a possibility that some feared outcome could happen, even if it’s a one-in-a-trillion chance. That doesn’t mean it’s probable, but OCD can take hold of the slightest uncertainty.",p,,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,72,5
3203,The illusion of certainty,h2,The illusion of certainty,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,4,1
3204,"Individuals who suffer from OCD get caught up in the need for certainty—but it is an illusion. We want to know for sure that whatever we are having intrusive thoughts about will never happen, or is completely false. We want to know without a shadow of a doubt that what we fear has no meaning. Here lies the dilemma: it is impossible to know absolutely for certain, or enough to ever satisfy OCD. The bar is too high. The stakes are too high. OCD attacks the very things that we value and care the most about. It attacks the core of our identities. That’s what makes it so compelling. ",p,The illusion of certainty,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,109,10
3205,"People who do not live with OCD can have the very same thoughts, images, and urges, and yet they are mostly unphased by them. They do not attribute meaning to them. In fact, if you asked someone without the disorder whether they experienced these same thoughts, they might say they don’t. That’s because when working properly, our brains are designed to weed out unhelpful, unneeded information. When your brain filters out unnecessary and faulty information, it can determine what actually needs your attention. People who do not have OCD are able to filter those thoughts out and pay so little attention to them that they may not even register. Even when they notice an intrusive thought, they can very readily dismiss it as “silly” or “weird.” They may think to themselves that it came out of nowhere and shrug it off, having enough confidence that it didn’t mean anything. ",p,The illusion of certainty,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,149,9
3206,"Unfortunately for those of us who suffer from OCD, this process isn’t working correctly. When we have a thought, image, or urge that goes against our values we stop and pay attention. Our brains turn on us. We are filled with fear and intense anxiety and we want to know why the thought was there in the first place. Our brains scream at us that something is wrong. The parts of our mind that are helpful to alert us to real danger and protect us have failed us. Our alarm system malfunctions. We get stuck on these thoughts and attribute meaning to them.

It helps us to survive. Think back to when you were a child—how did you learn what was dangerous versus what was safe? Anxiety likely played a pivotal role in this development. When you touched a hot surface you would feel pain, which would teach you not to touch the hot surface again. This lesson helped you to survive many other dangers that occur. This learning helped you to be cautious around fires, thus preventing disaster. Anxiety is present to protect and guide us when working effectively. ",p,Anxiety is not “bad”,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,121,11
3209,"Anxiety feels intense. Your brain is trying to get your attention. It is screaming at you to do something, to fight, flee, or freeze. This is a good thing when there is a real danger present. However, this is not useful when you have OCD and are experiencing intrusive thoughts. Your mind is sending you signals that you need to do something, even though there is no real risk. It is yelling at you that you need to take action. This is why OCD feels so real. There is a very real process taking place in your brain. The problem is that it is a faulty alarm; there is no actual danger. When you have OCD, you are left feeling all of the signals that there is imminent danger, but there isn’t. ",p,Anxiety is not “bad”,/blog/why-ocd-feels-so-real,132,12

ERP teaches a person with OCD that thoughts, feelings, and urges do not have to have meaning. They can just be background noise.

ERP treatment would likely not be effective for a client who does not wish to be there, as this treatment requires clients to be active participants in creating and implementing exercises.

3243,"What’s the alternative, you ask? Parents have the option of working with ERP clinicians to target their child’s OCD symptoms without the child’s involvement. These sessions would focus on assisting parents in gradually removing accommodations that are typically provided. When only the parental accommodations are removed, progress does typically occur, as children are not provided with the reassurance or support they think they require in order to feel better. In other words, they will habituate, or “get used to,” the anxiety and distress they will feel when they are not afforded the relief that comes with being accommodated. This method can also help increase your child’s motivation for treatment, as when accommodations are removed, the child may realize that OCD has more control over them than they would like.",p,Tip #3,/blog/when-to-push-and-when-not-to-push-your-kids-ocd,129,6

3247,"The gold standard of treatment for OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, not all forms of CBT are suited or beneficial for OCD. In fact, some may be counterproductive.

3249,"CBT is an umbrella term for different forms of evidence-based therapies based on the idea that the way someone thinks and behaves impacts their emotions and that all three of these facets impact one another in a cyclical fashion. CBT is used to treat various mental health conditions, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorders. The treatment focuses on a person’s present experience and is intended to be short-term. During CBT, a patient will learn practical skills to manage their anxiety and examine the core beliefs driving their decisions. CBT gives the patient practical skills to deal with their circumstances more productively. The goal is to learn how to change one’s thoughts and behaviors and provide necessary skills so that  the patient can eventually become their own therapist.",p,What is cognitive behavioral therapy and how does it work?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,132,7
3250,"Here’s an example of how these techniques are used in therapy. Someone may feel it’s unsafe to let anyone into their apartment. During CBT, the focus would be to examine this belief in order to overcome it. A therapist may ask, “What do you think will happen if you have a guest over?” or, “How likely do you think something bad will happen?” or, “Since nothing bad has happened in the past, do you think it’s reasonable to assume nothing bad will happen in the future?” Here’s where things might become tricky for someone with OCD.",p,What is cognitive behavioral therapy and how does it work?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,96,5
3251,"These are all reasonable questions, and for someone with a different condition, they may be helpful. However, when it comes to OCD, this treatment can actually encourage compulsions by providing reassurance. Many people with OCD seek reassurance to gain relief from the anxiety of their intrusive thoughts. When reassurance is used as a compulsion, the patient will find temporary relief but will not be working to treat their OCD in the long term.",,What is cognitive behavioral therapy and how does it work?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,73,5
3252,"Some of the techniques used in CBT to help people challenge their thoughts or manage uncomfortable emotions can become compulsive rituals for people with OCD. For example, a therapist may encourage this patient to repeat to themselves, “I am safe,” every time they feel anxious about contamination. For someone with OCD, this can easily become a compulsion used to relieve the stress of their intrusive thoughts.",p,What is cognitive behavioral therapy and how does it work?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,66,4

3254,"ERP therapy is the gold standard of treatment for OCD because it takes a targeted approach to address your obsessions and compulsions. In the example above, an ERP therapist would not reassure this patient by providing logical explanations against their fears of contamination. For someone with OCD, it’s likely they are already aware of every logical explanation and have tried to talk themselves out of their fears unsuccessfully.",p,What makes ERP the best treatment for OCD?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,68,4
3255,"ERP therapy takes the opposite approach. Instead of trying to stop your obsessive thoughts with reassurance, you welcome them. The idea behind ERP therapy is that exposure to these thoughts is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually engage in  compulsions like reassurance, it only strengthens your need to complete them in the future. In this example, a patient may feel better after a CBT session, but become dependent on the therapist’s reassurance or may quickly spiral into another cycle of obsession and compulsion when the doubt commonly experienced with OCD kicks in– but what if? On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond, provide yourself with the opportunity to learn that the feared outcome won’t occur or that you can handle it if it does, and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. ",p,What makes ERP the best treatment for OCD?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,153,6
3256,"During ERP therapy, you’ll work with a therapist to develop a hierarchy of anxieties and related exposures and gradually work your way through them.

Eventually, they will work up to being able to host a friend. ",,What makes ERP the best treatment for OCD?,/blog/cbt-good-treatment-ocd-erp-therapy,59,4

3260,"No story about new parents worrying a lot is going to turn heads. Infants are vulnerable in countless ways, and the blend of intense emotions in the months after a child is born can only heighten every anxious impulse. Worrying about a newborn is adaptive—but is it always? And what happens when a new parent’s mind seems to feed them the worst of all thoughts? It’s difficult to imagine a lonelier place than a home that’s supposed to be happy but is suddenly flooding with unwanted thoughts and terrifying urges. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,90,4
3261,"We hear a good amount about postpartum depression—a prolonged period of sadness, fatigue, anxiety, and other symptoms that follows childbirth. It robs up to 15% of mothers of their vitality in an already difficult period, and is probably caused by a variety of factors including hormonal changes. An estimated 10% of new fathers are affected too, with partners of depressed mothers more likely to develop the condition. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,67,4
3262,"By acknowledging postpartum depression, we poke holes in common assumptions about new parents: they’re supposed to be experiencing pure joy, they can only think “positive” things about infants and parenting, they have to be on top of their game to take care of their child. And now we know this condition isn’t rare at all; many new parents, especially mothers, experience depression far beyond the “baby blues.” ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,67,3
3263,"Much less common, though, is any awareness of postpartum OCD. Like postpartum depression, it emerges rapidly after childbirth (or occasionally right before) and can become debilitating to new parents. And, although it primarily affects new mothers (reportedly 1-3%), fathers can also demonstrate symptoms. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,43,4
3264,"According to Dr. Jonathan Abramowitz, Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, common obsessions for people with postpartum OCD include: ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,26,2
3265, • The idea that the baby could die in their sleep (S.I.D.S.) • An image of the baby dead  • Thoughts of the baby choking and not being able to save them • Unwanted impulses to shake the baby to see what would happen • Thought of stabbing the baby • Thoughts of drowning the baby during a bath,p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,59,5
3266,"And although there’s an understandable fear of talking about thoughts like these, Abramowitz says up to 80% of new mothers report “nasty, senseless, unacceptable, unwanted thoughts” about their own children. But unlike other parents experiencing these thoughts, people with postpartum OCD interpret theirs as urgently meaningful—as signs that something bad is bound to happen.  ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,54,3
3267,"Unwanted thoughts become obsessions as new parents find themselves unable to let them go. They turn to compulsive attempts in an attempt to mitigate the perceived danger, or the distress caused by the thoughts themselves. Going far beyond normal efforts to keep a young child safe, a new parent with postpartum OCD will perform compulsions like these: ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,57,3
3268,"• Checking on their child over and over, even throughout the night• Avoiding being around the child alone • Mentally repeating prayers or assertions about how much they care for the child  • Looking up unwanted thoughts on the internet  • Asking others if their child will be okay, or if they’re a good parent ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,55,1
3269,"These repetitive behaviors, though performed in response to the new parent’s anxiety about disturbing thoughts, aren’t serving to keep their child safe. In fact, besides exhausting new parents, the behaviors associated with postpartum OCD can reduce the quality of care a young child is getting. The good news, though, is that there’s help available to any parent  having “nasty, senseless, unacceptable” thoughts about their child.  ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,65,4
3270,"In a recent HuffPost piece, Catherine Pearson speaks with two mothers about their experiences with postpartum OCD. Both describe a distinct moment when their first disturbing thought appeared–one an image of smothering her baby, the other a recognition that she could throw her newborn down the stairs. Then the spiraling of their minds into more varied violent thoughts, and the development of compulsions. As Pearson writes: ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,66,4
3271,"Notareschi describes the typical components of OCD: trigger, obsession, compulsion. Her catastrophic assessment of disturbing thoughts triggered by potentially dangerous situations, and the compulsive behaviors that follow, separate postpartum OCD from typical parental worry. Unaware of what was happening, convinced these thoughts urgently needed attention, she developed very specific compulsions—repeating a seemingly nonsensical phrase among them. But to her this wasn’t nonsense; it was a way to protect her child from the inevitability that she’d harm her. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,77,5
3272,"It may be impossible to make parenting easy, but there are effective interventions for postpartum OCD. It’s treated in much the same way as any other type of OCD, except that more caution may be required with SRI medications for breastfeeding mothers. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with a focus on exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective at helping new parents learn different responses to obsessions. Treatment doesn’t require any kind of removal from the child—in fact, learning not to withdraw is often part of ERP therapy. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,86,5
3273,"We don’t know what causes postpartum OCD, but we do know it exists. Extreme feelings of fear and shame around the idea of letting a helpless child get hurt or hurting them oneself are compounded by a general lack of good information about OCD, making it unlikely that a suffering parent will get help. But there’s no need for any parent to spend the first part of their child’s life stuck in an obsessive-compulsive cycle. ",p,,/blog/postpartum-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-symptoms-and-treatment,75,4

However, they’re not without their struggles, and people dealing with relationship anxiety may find them particularly difficult to maneuver at times. ",p,,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,36,4
3325,"Someone with relationship anxiety might find themselves focusing on stressful or worrying thoughts, but they likely won’t be drawn to act on them with cyclical behaviors. Someone with relationship obsessive-compulsive disorder (or ROCD), however, has an added layer to the worries around their relationship in the form of compulsions — and it can pile on unnecessary struggle to otherwise healthy romantic relationships. Let’s take a closer look at the similarities and differences in these conditions. ",p,,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,75,4

3327,"Relationship anxiety refers to worries, insecurities and doubts that may pop up in a relationship, even when everything seems to be going well. It’s an incredibly common condition, and it often happens at the beginning of relationships before each partner understands the other’s level of commitment or interest.",p,Relationship anxiety vs. relationship OCD,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,48,3
3328,"You may have felt this kind of anxiety before in new friendships or romantic relationships, and it may pass or come back intermittently. It can cause emotional distress, fatigue and other common symptoms of anxiety, but it typically does not trigger compulsions like relationship OCD does. ",,Relationship anxiety vs. relationship OCD,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,46,3
3329,"People dealing with ROCD struggle with obsessions and compulsions related to their relationships and feelings that surface as a result of those relationships. In this OCD subtype, the uncertainty of intimate relationships can lead to obsessive-compulsive cycles. Any hint of imperfection might launch these cycles, and these compulsions can consume a lot of time and energy, making the relationship more difficult.",p,Relationship anxiety vs. relationship OCD,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,61,4
3330,"Unlike relationship anxiety — where the trigger may simply lead to uncomfortable or uncertain thoughts about the relationship — ROCD often leads to intrusive thoughts and compulsive responses. For example, someone with ROCD might make eye contact with someone outside of their romantic relationship that they find attractive, and it could lead to all-consuming and completely intrusive thoughts. They might then feel the need to question themselves and ask their friends, “Should I be with someone more like that?” Situations like this can quickly turn into repetitive cycles that happen any time the individual makes eye contact with someone they find attractive. ",p,Relationship anxiety vs. relationship OCD,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,102,4

3332,"Since ROCD is one form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is likewise highly treatable with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, the gold standard of OCD treatment. This treatment works by exposing those with OCD to their triggers in a safe and controlled environment while they work to actively resist compulsions brought on by those triggers. It can be uncomfortable at first, but over time it helps to free those with OCD from the constraints of their compulsions and live their lives more comfortably and with more control. ",p,How is relationship OCD treated? ,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,87,4
3333,"In someone with ROCD, exposure and response prevention works toward showing the patient that they’re able to tolerate intrusive thoughts about their relationship without having to act on them. This allows those with ROCD to have better insight into their compulsions and understand that their intrusive thoughts about their relationship do not have to determine the trajectory of that relationship. ",,How is relationship OCD treated? ,/blog/relationship-anxiety-relationship-ocd,60,3
3334,"ERP for this condition works best when the therapist conducting this therapy specializes in treating OCD symptoms. Look for a therapist that has experience or training in ERP and OCD specifically—even better if they have experience particular to ROCD.

While this person’s rational mind may acknowledge that this is a distorted belief — there’s no direct connection between doing the action and her parents’ health — the brain has been conditioned to act on it with excessive diligence.

3466,"It is hard enough being a parent. Parenting children can be a difficult gig. It can also be a beautiful and rewarding adventure. It doesn’t come with a guidebook. It doesn’t come with concrete instructions. In all truth, caregivers learn as they go. Parenting multiple children can look differently as well. Parenting is not a “one size fits all”. I often tell families I work with that, you parent based on who your children are and what they need. This may look different for each child that you parent and that is okay. ",p,,/blog/help-my-sibling-has-ocd,93,11
3467,You may be a parent of multiple children. You likely are reading this article because you are concerned about a child of yours who is a sibling to a child with OCD. It is important to recognize that OCD is a family affair. It impacts the entire unit. OCD is the elephant in the middle of the room. We can all pretend it isn’t there and look away but it will still be there. It needs to be talked about. ,p,,/blog/help-my-sibling-has-ocd,80,8

3469,Children who have a sibling with OCD may feel like they don’t get the same amount of attention. They may feel left out or alone in their struggles. They may not want to burden parents by putting more on their plates because they know the parents may be stressed and dealing with the child who is experiencing severe mental health symptoms. Siblings may withdraw or retreat to their room to be away from the chaos or the rigidity of the sufferer.,,,/blog/help-my-sibling-has-ocd,81,5
3470,The sufferer may be putting high demands on their siblings due to the nature of their compulsions. They may be asking the sibling to participate in rituals or they may demand that they do things in a particular way. This can be extremely frustrating to the sibling who doesn’t understand the reason that their brother or sister is acting that way. They may just see this as the child with OCD being bossy and demanding. This may cause intense anger towards that child.,p,,/blog/help-my-sibling-has-ocd,83,6
3471,They may experience jealousy- they may feel like the sibling with OCD gets all of the attention.

We may feel alone, out of control, and unsure of how to manage all our responsibilities. We may experience irritability, disrupted sleep, headaches, lack of energy and motivation, and changes in eating habits. There may also be feelings of guilt, shame, and worry as we fear failing our children. In extreme cases, we may develop a sense of helplessness and hopelessness about life altogether.

My typical day involves homeschooling my boys, my daughter’s school and extracurricular activities, working part-time, and graduate school assignments.

Stress accumulates and can take a toll on us, especially when we have a child who is dealing with OCD and/or another mental health disorder that requires much of our attention and emotional energy. We may find it challenging to remain compassionate and patient with them when burnout is a reality. This is particularly true when the stress is coupled with little or no support or without the proper tools to help us cope.

What can be eliminated from the schedule, maybe even temporary, so that life is less overwhelming and demanding? Do my children know they are a priority? How can I prioritize their needs while keeping up with work and other activities? It may be helpful to make a list to go over with your spouse, a close friend, and/or a therapist.

3485,"The term obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, has a long history and has been understood, treated and interpreted in a wide variety of ways before arriving at the definition we use today. We now have extensive research and information available on OCD, what it is, the different subtypes and how to treat it. Although it is likely that forms of obsession and compulsion have been around since people have been around, it has taken us many centuries of research and trial and error to arrive at the knowledge on OCD we have today. ",p,,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,92,4

3487,"We can trace historical records of symptoms that overlap with OCD back to the 14th and 16th centuries. At the time, what we now call OCD was often discussed in a religious context. The term “scrupulosity” was first used by the Roman Catholic church to describe being overly concerned about one’s religious sins and performing compulsive acts for the purpose of atonement. The usage of this term to describe this type of behavior implies that this phenomena was at least common enough to necessitate a term to describe it.",p,Beginning origins of OCD,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,89,5
3488,"Scrupulosity was described in detail by various historical and religious figures in writing. In the 17th century Richard Baxter, a British clergyman, was considered a source for help for those experiencing scrupulosity, or melancholy, which was another term to describe obsession at the time. Baxter wrote in detail about this condition: “Some melancholy, conscientious persons are still accusing themselves, through mere scrupulosity; questioning almost all they eat, or drink, or wear, or do, whether it be not too much or too pleasing. But it is a cheerful sobriety which God requireth, which neither pampereth the body, nor yet disableth or hindereth it from its duty ; and not an unprofitable, wrangling scrupulosity.” ",p,Beginning origins of OCD,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,112,5
3489,"Another notable figure to discuss scrupulosity was philosopher and physician John Locke, who in the late 1600s wrote in a letter: “I cannot imagine that God, who has compassion upon our weakness and knows how we are made, would put poor men, nay, the best of men, those that seek him with sincerity and truth, under almost an absolute necessity of sinning perpetually against him, which will almost inevitably follow if there be no latitude at all allowed as in the occurrences of our lives.”",p,Beginning origins of OCD,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,85,2
3490,"It is likely that obsession and compulsion were first described in a religious context during the 14th to 17th centuries because religion played a huge part of everyday life. People were used to sharing their physical and mental ailments with their local religious figures. Today, religious or scrupulosity OCD is considered just one subtype of OCD as a whole, where a person experiences intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images or urges about violating their religious, moral or ethical beliefs. In the following centuries, symptoms of OCD would come to be recognized and researched in a medical context as well, eventually leading to our contemporary understanding of OCD.",p,Beginning origins of OCD,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,105,5

3492,"In the 1700s, physicians wanted to help those living with OCD, but there was not yet enough scientific understanding of the condition to devise an effective treatment. One common practice was called “bloodletting” where doctors drew blood from a patient in an attempt to rebalance their bodily “humors” — today, we know that medicine does not rely on the so-called humors, and that bloodletting does NOT treat OCD, but at the time it was used for many things.",p,Medical Research on OCD ,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,78,3
3493,"During the 1700s and 1800s, physicians began to describe a few symptoms that we can recognize today, such as compulsive washing or checking, obsessive fear of syphilis and aggressive and sexual obsessions. At this point, scrupulosity began to be considered a medical ailment rather than a strictly religious one. As mental institutions became more common, more people diagnosed with scrupulosity came to be diagnosed and institutionalized in asylums. By the end of the 19th century, however, the diagnosis was no longer considered a form of insanity. ",p,Medical Research on OCD ,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,86,5
3494,"Eventually, physicians took a more specialized approach in classifying mental illness, and diagnosed specific symptoms separately. Some of these resemble what we now consider OCD subtypes. For example, physicians came up with names for arithmomania (compulsive counting), mysophobia (obsessive fear of contamination) and agoraphobia. Physicians also tried prescribing various medications to their patients who were experiencing these conditions. ",p,Medical Research on OCD ,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,58,5
3495,"Our modern-day understanding of OCD began to solidify in the early 20th century, most notably through the pioneering research of psychiatrists Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet. Freud came up with the term “Zwangsneurose” to describe what he observed in patients dealing with obsession. The term was later translated in London as “compulsion,” and then in New York as “obsession.” Eventually, the diagnosis came to be called “obsessive-compulsive,” which was a compromise between the two translations.By the 1970s, behavioral psychology became a more popular form of treating anxiety disorders over Freudian analysis. Rather than talk therapy, behavioral psychologists eventually came to believe that the best way to treat conditions like OCD was through a process of controlled desensitisation to the source of distress. This paved the foundation for exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, which is now considered the gold standard for OCD treatment, and has been proven to be 90% effective.",p,Medical Research on OCD ,/blog/how-long-has-ocd-been-around,151,8

Something tells you that a certain action would help you feel better and even if you don’t understand why it works, you do it. Soon it becomes your first response to those intense, distressing thoughts and seems to be the only thing that helps alleviate discomfort or make the thoughts go away.  Despite the repeated compulsions and attempts to neutralize recurrent intrusive thoughts, the thoughts come back, time and again and you remain stuck in the cycle of OCD. ",p,,/blog/what-is-a-compulsion-ocd-erp,100,5

Some compulsion might be visible but many of these compulsions are internal; mental.

You temporarily feel better. Your brain notices the reduction in anxiety from acting on that thought, and the next time you start obsessing over it, your mind tells you that the same compulsion will help. You do the compulsion; you feel better. This is the most difficult thing about a compulsion — it reinforces itself.

3529,"Many people who struggle with recurrent thoughts, images, or urges that are intrusive and unwanted (i.e., obsessions) notice that they respond to these obsessions by engaging in repetitive mental or physical behaviors to decrease their levels of distress (i.e., compulsions). The frequent pairing of obsessions and compulsions together is how many individuals come to understand they are experiencing symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Understanding the diagnosis often serves as an important gateway to seeking much-needed treatment.",p,,/blog/why-not-all-compulsions-are-visible,76,8
3530,"Other individuals, however, might dismiss the possibility of OCD because they don’t feel like they experience any particular repetitive behavior that results from their obsessions.

3531,"During my clinical training to become an NOCD therapist, I found out that many people actually perform purely mental compulsions to relieve the distress caused by their obsessive thoughts. While these mental compulsions aren’t as visible as a physical compulsion, like repetitive hand-washing, they are still very distressing and are responsible for significant life interference for most individuals who experience them. Importantly, mental compulsions certainly don’t mean that a person wouldn’t meet the diagnostic criteria for OCD. ",p,,/blog/why-not-all-compulsions-are-visible,77,4

A person with scrupulosity OCD, however, might not recognize the compulsion in their habit of mentally reviewing every detail of a particular interaction to make sure that they didn’t behave in a “sinful” or “amoral” way. They might not realize that when done frequently and with the purpose of relieving anxiety, mental reviewing is a compulsion.",p,,/blog/why-not-all-compulsions-are-visible,88,4
3533,"Even if they recognize that these compulsive mental acts are distressing, they might rationalize them by labeling them as a normal response to a stressful social situation. But the key between a normative reaction to stress and a mental compulsion is a sense of urgency related to performing a compulsion, as well as the repetitive nature of the entire experience. The desire to find certainty at all costs, or to prevent something horrible from happening through performing the mental act, is the tell-tale sign that it has become a mental compulsion. ",p,,/blog/why-not-all-compulsions-are-visible,91,4

A person who has pedophilia OCD or harm OCD, or who otherwise obsesses about their “goodness” as an individual, might be particularly prone to scenario twisting.

Many are scared of using labels and scared of the impact OCD may have on their relationships, career opportunities, and even how they are perceived by others. It’s no wonder that people hide their symptoms, given the nature of how people with mental illness were treated or dismissed historically.

3553,"When I was growing up in the 1980s, very little was known about OCD. I don’t think I had even heard of it until around 1995. There were no TV shows depicting characters that even represented the misguided, stereotypical views of OCD we see in today’s media. During my childhood, there was a vast silence when it came to this topic, at least in my household (and I suspect in the homes of many others). So when I began to experience symptoms, I knew something was going on, but I had no words for it. I saw it as a mysterious thing that would show up and torment me. ",p,The stigma surrounding mental illness ,/blog/suffering-in-silence-made-my-ocd-symptoms-worse,109,7
3554,"Now, over my years of being a therapist and specializing in OCD, I have found that this air of mystery surrounding OCD still exists in many ways for the people I’ve treated. They, too, experienced the struggles of having a condition that very few people truly understand, let alone know how to treat. Many lived in shame and guilt, wondering if they had done something wrong to deserve this or if they were somehow contributing to the severity of it. If they had it as a child, as I did, they may have been scolded or told to simply “knock it off.” They may also have been seen as attention-seekers or as having behavioral problems. ",p,The stigma surrounding mental illness ,/blog/suffering-in-silence-made-my-ocd-symptoms-worse,115,6
3555,"It’s no wonder that so many with OCD would want to hide their symptoms. They learn very quickly that when you allow people to see the symptoms that you experience on a daily basis,  there may be negative consequences. But it doesn’t need to be that way. It is important for more people to talk about their experiences, as this leads to more understanding and helps educate people so that no one else needs to go through those experiences ever again. That is what makes platforms that share OCD stories so powerful, and that is why I have chosen to share my own struggles. ",p,The stigma surrounding mental illness ,/blog/suffering-in-silence-made-my-ocd-symptoms-worse,104,6

They could tell I was in some sort of distress, but they didn’t understand what was happening. I would ask puzzling questions and demand answers to questions that could not be answered with certainty. I would confess the most mundane things and look for reassurance that I was okay. I wanted approval that these things were acceptable.

3558,"Part of my story is that I grew up in a very strict household. I learned from a very young age that showing emotions that were seen as negative was often unacceptable. I was punished for things that were often innocent mistakes. For example, I would constantly throw away brand-new clothes because I had intrusive thoughts that they were contaminated. Or I would refuse to eat specific foods for fear of choking, but in my house, you were taught to eat everything that was on your plate. I would have to sit at the dinner table for hours because no one knew that’s why I wouldn’t eat. My parents’ rules had to be followed, no exceptions. My dad once told me that if he had a rule, he always stuck to it – even if he regretted the rule later. “Say what you mean and always follow through on it” was his motto.

3606,"So let’s start with what we know. OCD is a cycle of obsessions and compulsions, often brought on by triggers that lead to intrusive thoughts or intrusive thoughts themselves. Obsessions can be about a number of things, such as a fear of germs or a fear of causing harm to oneself or someone else. You can have have OCD about past events, relationships, magical thinking, religious OCD and sexual orientation OCD. These obsessions often become so uncomfortable for those with OCD that they engage in compulsions to try to end the discomfort associated with their obsessions. ",p,What is OCD? ,/blog/what-if-my-ocd-isnt-ocd,96,6

3622,Magical thinking obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype characterized by ongoing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors around superstition or magical thinking to prevent negative experiences or harm to oneself or others. People with magical thinking OCD experience frequent intrusive thoughts that they will be responsible for something awful happening if they do not perform specific actions.,p,,/blog/what-is-magical-thinking-ocd,57,3
3623,"An individual’s underlying anxiety could be specific (e.g., If I don’t make the bed, my spouse will get into an automobile accident) or it can be undefined (e.g., If I don’t turn my phone on and off three times every day, something bad will happen to my mother). There is often no connection between what a person fears and the action they perform to prevent it. Even if the person logically understands their fear and rituals are not connected or rational, the fear of causing oneself or another person harm is so great that they’ll engage in their compulsions just to be sure (e.g., I’ll turn my phone on and off three times just to be on the safe side. What’s the big deal?).",p,,/blog/what-is-magical-thinking-ocd,124,11
3624,"Magical thinking OCD compulsions may start small, but they can snowball over time. In more severe cases, magical thinking OCD can impede someone’s ability to function in their everyday life. These rituals can become incredibly time-consuming and lead a person to avoid situations, locations, or people as part of their compulsions. ",,,/blog/what-is-magical-thinking-ocd,51,4
3625,"For example, a person’s magical thinking OCD can convince them the reason they failed their exam is because they didn’t sharpen 10 pencils before the test.

How else am I supposed to understand this?” ",p,,/blog/what-is-magical-thinking-ocd,67,5
3626,Magical thinking OCD may also worsen after hearing about a tragedy. A person may feel they are responsible for a tragic event because they did not perform a specific ritual years ago.

3629,"The best course of treatment for magical thinking OCD, like all types of OCD, is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. The idea behind ERP is that repeated exposure to obsessive thoughts, without engaging in compulsions, is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually reach out for the compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. ",p,Magical thinking OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-magical-thinking-ocd,92,5

The therapist might point out how there’s no relationship between when you call someone and a potential tragedy.

A therapist may ask you to send a text without checking the time at all. At first, you might think, “That’s impossible. If I do that, something bad will happen to the person I am texting and it will by my fault.” If an exposure feels too overwhelming to start with, you’ll work with the therapist to find the right intensity for you.

People would be skeptical and confused, and any botched surgery would be disastrous for the patient. Yet, that’s what I see happening now to many people with OCD. Therapists are claiming to treat OCD without having specialized training in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, and then, the people with OCD whom they treat become completely unable to function. These patients can end up imprisoned in their own minds. ",p,,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,97,6

Beware of the following types of therapists:",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,57,2

3689,"Treatment for OCD involves ERP therapy and/or SSRI medication. According to Dr. Patrick McGrath, NOCD’s Chief Clinical Officer and a Scientific Advisor of the International OCD Foundation, “Exposure and Response Prevention therapy is the gold standard of care for OCD. ERP therapy is what helps people with OCD see significant reductions in OCD severity and then stay better long-term. ERP can be done alone or in conjunction with medication.”",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,69,6

Therefore, if you ask a therapist about ERP and receive any hesitation, avoid that provider – no matter how friendly he or she may seem! ",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,36,2
3691,"2. The therapist that says they do ERP therapy, but never creates a personalized ERP treatment plan or actively does ERP exercises with you. ",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,24,3
3692,"One of the first things a true ERP therapist will do with you is create a “fear ladder,” otherwise known as a hierarchy, to understand the types of exposure exercises you should work on together. After building a hierarchy with you, your therapist should then actively set up exposure exercises, similar to the way a personal trainer would set up different exercises for you to do. Your therapist should be creative in helping you purposefully trigger your OCD fears and should actively teach you how to respond to each fear without doing compulsive behaviors. Then, once it’s time to do the exercise, your therapist should actively be involved. ",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,108,5
3693,"Beware of the therapist who doesn’t formally do either of these things. If you have a sneaking suspicion that your therapist doesn’t know what he or she is doing, don’t be afraid to ask for details on how he or she was trained to treat OCD with ERP. ",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,48,3

3695,"Therapists that really specialize in OCD and ERP are typically empathetic, but they also have mastered the ability to offer “tough love.” My personal OCD specialized therapist, Kelly Sansone, exemplified this perfectly while I was in treatment. When I sought reassurance in between sessions, she would directly tell me, “Maybe that could be true, Stephen; I guess you’ll find out one day.” Offering tough love is a necessary evil to teach people with OCD how to stop doing compulsions. Due to her expertise in treating OCD, Kelly without a doubt helped me avoid a severe OCD relapse.",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,97,6
3696,"On the other hand, therapists falsely claiming expertise in OCD will give in to the requests of their patients and consistently offer reassurance, because they don’t know any better. It is typically not meant to be malicious, but as mental health professionals, it’s still unacceptable. The stakes are too high. To identify if your therapist is a “reassurance-giver,” I’d encourage you to observe the amount of time the therapist spends talking with you about your OCD fears vs. actually doing exercises to try and teach you how to respond to them effectively. ",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,92,6

3698,"Well-trained OCD specialists won’t be phased by the disturbing fears that you’re experiencing. They know that OCD manifests in really taboo and bizarre formats, and that’s partially why they sign up to become specialists in treating the condition. For instance, Dr. McGrath carries a piece of paper in his wallet that says “666 – I hope my parents die tonight” just to portray his willingness to hear thoughts that are considered taboo from his members, and to actively participate in treatment with them. (He actually likes his parents, but did this with a patient who had a fear of this statement. Now, he uses it with many of his patients during treatment.)",p,What to look out for,/blog/beware-many-licensed-therapists-claim-false-specialty-in-ocd,112,7
3699,"Conversely, many therapists who claim false expertise in OCD might get noticeably uncomfortable when you communicate your OCD fears, or they might offer the wrong advice. One therapist that I saw told me that he never worked with anyone who had the same “problem” as me. He then deemed my family as the root of all my issues and advised me to get away from them. As a result, I packed my bags and moved thousands of miles away, just to see if that would make a difference.

OCD typically latches on to the things that are most important to you and that you feel strongest about, filling your mind with intense doubt. It’s as if you’re at war and OCD has been given a detailed map of your battle plan ahead of time, so that it can sneak in and attack the very things that you try the hardest to protect. ",p,Values under attack,/blog/values-over-fear-in-ocd,83,4

Even with my years of experience, from dealing with the disorder personally and from treating it professionally, I do not have all of the answers. What I do know is that the more you allow OCD to win battles, the more it takes over your life. It’s only through accepting feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, and by embracing the what if’s, that you can truly begin to win the war on OCD. ",p,Values under attack,/blog/values-over-fear-in-ocd,96,5

Often, they don’t even realize that they had these symptoms for so long, as they were seemingly manageable, and only a nuisance. But eventually, the disorder became so out-of-control that they decided to seek help.

3726,"Contamination OCD is a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) where a person experiences obsessive thoughts around fears of becoming contaminated, contaminating others, or contracting and spreading a disease. These obsessive thoughts drive people to engage in various compulsions aimed at alleviating their anxieties about contamination (e.g., showering for hours or until they feel clean). ",p,,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,54,5

3728,", and there are many different symptoms any individual person can experience. They could either fear contracting a specific disease or illness (e.g., botulism) or fear contamination in general. Some physical compulsions include excessive hand-washing or showering, avoiding crowded spaces, using hand sanitizer excessively, or frequently changing one’s clothes. ",,,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,49,6
3729,"Excessive research is another compulsion, and a person may spend hours online looking up disease, bacteria, and how to prevent contamination. For example, they may spend an entire night researching the potential of getting food poisoning and become convinced their last meal will make them sick, despite no physical symptoms. Sufferers may avoid situations or people. They might leave garbage in their home due to fear of becoming contaminated while disposing of it, or spend hours making a mental list of what is clean and what is dirty. (e.g., I let my friend use my pen, and I touched the pen when she gave it back to me, and now everything I touched is dirty).",p,,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,115,8
3730,"People with contamination OCD may also experience fears of emotional contamination. For example, a person may fear that thinking or speaking about an illness will contaminate them. They may avoid talking about someone they know is sick because they are afraid any mention of this person will contaminate others. They might fear watching a movie or reading a book about someone ill will make them sick. ",p,,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,66,5
3731,"People with contamination OCD are driven to know whether something is contaminated with 100% certainty. As long as even a tiny fraction of doubt remains, the obsessions and compulsions will continue. Even when it seems a compulsion has effectively relieved their anxiety (e.g., I just washed my hands 10 times, so now I finally know I’m clean), it’s only a matter of time before more obsessive thoughts arise.",p,,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,68,6

The idea behind ERP is that repeated exposure to obsessive thoughts, without engaging in compulsions, is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually reach out for the compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. ",p,Contamination OCD ERP therapy,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,91,5

As part of ERP therapy, you will track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of how distressing each thought is. You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions.

This compulsion has become painfully isolating, and it prevents you from hosting friends and feeling close to the people in your life. You may truly want to host a friend, but the fear of contamination prevents you from being able to.With a therapist, you’ll work toward overcoming the compulsion to keep your living room off-limits so that you’re able to host people in your space again. At first, you might think, “I can’t have anyone over. That’s impossible. I’ll do anything but that.” If an exposure feels too overwhelming to start with, you’ll work with the therapist to find the right intensity for you.

They may bring up many of the fears you’ve been trying to alleviate with your compulsions (e.g., What if I bring an object into my space and my whole living room becomes contaminated?). However, when you realize your worst fears aren’t actualized through these actions, you’ll start to become more comfortable with the uncertainty and anxiety driving your compulsive behaviors. With practice, you’ll find the intense need to engage in your compulsion will wane and you reach a point where you can invite friends over without fear. ",,Examples of contamination OCD ERP exposure ,/blog/what-is-contamination-ocd,106,7

We also know that people with OCD may have high levels of distress intolerance, meaning they are not confident that they can tolerate feelings of anxiety or distress. A large part of ERP is learning that they can actually tolerate your feelings, as hard as this may seem at the moment. The more you expose yourself to the things that trigger your intrusive thoughts, feelings, and urges, the less anxious you will be, and the more you will recognize that you are able to tolerate discomfort. ERP will teach you that while discomfort is not pleasant, it’s also not dangerous, it won’t last forever, and you can tolerate it without resorting to compulsions. In this way ERP can also help you increase your overall self-efficacy, or your own perceived ability to do challenging things.",p,Your therapist’s role in ERP,/blog/is-erp-cruel,169,7

You may only be in sessions 1-2 hours per week, leaving you alone for 99% of the week. That’s why homework is a pivotal part of treatment: ERP cannot be successful without practice.

I am filled with memories of missed opportunities, forgotten dreams, and impaired relationships.",p,,/blog/understanding-what-ocd-recovery-means,54,5
3807,"Specifically, when I look back, there are so many things that OCD kept me from doing. When I was 15 years old, I remember being excited to attend an exclusive fine arts camp. It was costly,  but I had talked my parents into letting me go. It was something I am sure I would have loved and that likely would have been an amazing, one-of-a-kind experience. ",p,,/blog/understanding-what-ocd-recovery-means,66,5
3808,"Once I was accepted, I was filled with joy. But within days, this joy was replaced by extreme fear and worry. I began to dread the trip I had just been so ecstatic for. I was scared to be away from my safe haven; I had created a bubble, and leaving it seemed too frightening.

People grieve when they have experienced something tragic, and yet we rarely hear people talk about grieving the loss of their mental health or of a loved one’s mental health.

It is not perfection, and it is not the absence of symptoms. It is having the ability to cope with and face the things that once held you back from experiencing the life you wanted to live. Maybe the illness kept you from doing things you truly wanted to do. Maybe it made you believe things that were not true about yourself.

3843,"Answer: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy is the go-to treatment, since it is the gold-standard, long-term therapy intervention for OCD. If your therapist answers this question with confidence, that’s likely a good sign. When doing ERP therapy, many OCD specialists will also integrate principles of mindfulness and acceptance commitment therapy. In addition to ERP, some people are prescribed SSRI medication to help them manage OCD symptoms, which eventually gets them to a place where they can do ERP therapy. Your therapist may bring up the benefits of taking medication for OCD. When considering SSRI medication, be sure to understand all of the potential side effects with your doctor. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,109,7
3844,"Tips For Asking the Question: Be sure to not use the terms “Exposure and Response Prevention” or  “ERP” in the question first. Instead, let your therapist state for themselves that they provide ERP. If you propose a leading question such as, “Do you use ERP for OCD?” your therapist might say they do (when they in fact don’t) to get your business. It’s pretty unethical, but it happens all of the time. Beware of the types of therapists who claim false speciality in OCD!",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,84,5
3845,Question 2: What types of taboo intrusive thoughts have people with OCD shared with you in the past? ,p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,18,1
3846,"Answer: A true OCD specialist should offer at least a few interesting stories about OCD cases that may be considered taboo. In fact, he or she may even answer the question saying, “There isn’t an OCD thought that I haven’t heard before, so try me by sharing some of the ones that you’re experiencing.” Therapists who truly become specialized to treat OCD typically have a personality type that embraces discomfort. For example, NOCD’s Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. Patrick McGrath, worked with a patient who had violent intrusive thoughts. As part of his patient’s personalized ERP treatment plan, Dr. McGrath once conducted an exposure where he stood on a train platform and asked this patient to push him in front of a moving train, knowing that it would be a valuable exercise. (Dr. McGrath is fine and still with us today, as his patient did not push him into the train as his OCD made him fear he would. Instead, the exercise led to significant treatment gains for the patient). ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,169,11
3847,"Tips for Asking the Question: Let the therapist do most of the talking here. If the therapist broady talks about the hallmark symptoms of OCD or says something such as “Everyone has a little OCD,” watch out. However, if the therapist gets into the weeds and starts talking about the variety of subtypes that he or she has seen or shares stories related to taboo, aggressive, or sexual intrusive thoughts, you might have the right therapist in front of you. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,80,4
3848,Question 3: Have you received extra training to specifically treat OCD? ,p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,11,1
3849,"Answer: The therapist should say yes. In addition to being a licensed psychologist, social worker, marriage and family therapist, or counselor,  a licensed therapist who specializes in OCD will have gone through additional training. For instance, true OCD specialists might have studied under a world-renowned OCD expert, completed a specific and reputable training such as the The Behavior Therapy Training Institute (BTTI), or worked within an ERP-specific treatment network. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,69,4
3850,"Tips for Asking the Question: After asking this question, watch the expression of the therapist. If the therapist seems to be annoyed by the question, he or she might actually be defensive due to a lack of expertise. Or worse, they may be someone who has claimed false expertise in treating OCD. A true OCD specialist may actually commend you for asking the question and will likely be delighted to share more about their training.",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,75,5
3851,"Question 4: Can you help me make my intrusive thoughts, images, or urges go away?",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,15,1
3852,"Answer: The answer is no. The goal of OCD treatment isn’t to make your OCD thoughts, images, and urges go away; it’s to make sure that you can change your reaction to them, so that eventually they stop bothering you as much. A therapist whose expertise is treating OCD will explain this, while a therapist who doesn’t know as much might be more agreeable to the question and make false promises. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,71,4
3853,Tips for Asking the Question: You might want to ask for specific examples of how the prospective therapist helps people respond to their OCD thoughts. An experienced therapist might give examples of how he or she helps patients do “response prevention” even if they don’t say verbatim that it’s response prevention. ,p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,51,3
3854,"Question 5: When treating OCD, do you typically stay in an office setting, or do you venture out with your patients to additional locations? ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,24,1
3855,"Answer: Good OCD specialists will get creative with their treatment exercises, and many will go to different locations with you if possible. Telehealth has actually made it easier for therapists to venture out into the community with you, since the convenience of meeting with them over a screen means you can take them with you to other places to confront – and overcome – your fears and anxieties in your daily life. Therefore, it isn’t surprising to learn that many specialists believe that OCD is more effectively treated in a virtual environment. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,92,4
3856,"Tips for Asking the Question: If the therapist avoids getting specific about some of their past treatment exercises, it might be a good idea to ask additional questions. In this case, you should consider specifically addressing the types of treatment exercises other patients with your subtype(s) have done in the past with the therapist. Although ERP therapy is the gold-standard treatment for all OCD subtypes, there are specific types of treatment exercises therapists often conduct for each subtype.  ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,78,4

3858,"Now that you’re equipped with the right questions to ask, you may be wondering if there is a good place to start your therapist search. The answer is yes. Although I’m biased since I’m the Co-founder and CEO of NOCD, I’d recommend starting your search by browsing the NOCD Therapist Directory. NOCD can guarantee that each therapist in our directory has been trained in ERP, and our world-renowned clinical leadership team invests in training and actively mentoring them. Further, NOCD Therapists have training to do personalized treatment exercises in a telehealth setting, and many accept insurance. ",p,,/blog/five-questions-to-find-out-if-your-therapist-can-effectively-treat-ocd,96,6

3862,How to help a child with OCD and Autism,h1,title,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,9,1
3863,"If you have an autistic child, they might exhibit some behaviors that look similar to compulsions in OCD, like having to wear certain clothes, lining up toys in a certain way, or engaging in specific routines & rituals.",p,,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,38,2
3864,"OCD rituals, aka compulsions, can look similar to the repetitive behaviors common in Autism, as a 2011 study found that about 17% of people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also meet criteria for OCD.  However, the difference between repetitive behaviors in Autism and those in OCD is that autistic children often engage in the behaviors to feel more secure, to self-soothe, or because of sensory issues.  With OCD, compulsions are done consciously from feared thoughts to relieve anxiety or prevent something bad from happening.  In an autistic child with OCD, sometimes the reasons for these repetitive behaviors can overlap. If you interrupt either, your autistic child might become very upset, just for different reasons for if it’s ASD or OCD. ",p,,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,121,6
3865,"Exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP) is the best treatment for OCD. It decreases the need for an autistic child to use compulsions as a way to self-soothe. The treatment is more gradual and specific, and progresses slowly for more success with someone on the spectrum versus a child who is more neurotypical.  This is because of differences in the brain and that generally it can take longer for an autistic child (or adult) to habituate to their anxiety and distress as well as for those learnings to generalize from the therapy session out into the rest of their world. An autistic child might really like the relief that compulsions bring and may not want to stop them at first. To be very clear, ERP is used only to address OCD symptoms and not for the autism itself. ",p,,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,138,7

3868,"Parents should be involved in therapy sessions and ERP practice at home.  Team with your child’s therapist to understand how to structure exposure practice at home. As parents, you might be asked to make some adjustments to any OCD accommodations that might have developed at home. The school team also needs to be aware of your child’s treatment for OCD.  Frequent and thorough communication between team members is essential.",p,1.

3870,"Many autistic children do well with visual cues.  Having charts or pictures to show the agenda for practice, exposures and reinforcers is beneficial.  Some children will love drawing pictures illustrating how they can defeat OCD.  It can be extra effective if some of the explanation visuals reflect your child’s special interests. Coping cards describing how kids can work through being stuck can be helpful.  Using social stories can help explain the reasons for exposures and how to do them, and the benefit of reducing compulsions.  A good source for learning about how to implement social stories is Carol Gray’s work (https://carolgraysocialstories.com).",p,2.   Use visuals  ,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,101,9

3872,"Ask fewer questions.  Talk less.  Do not force eye contact. Give time to process information.  Let them set the pace.  Give praise for effort.  Modify language if the child has communication challenges by using pictures, communication boards.  Autistic individuals struggle to process much of anything if they’re experiencing sensory overload, so also be aware of the sensory stimuli in their environment during ERP. ",p,3.  Communication tips  ,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,63,9

3874,"Autistic children with OCD can be resistant to a change in schedule or routine because those are things that help make the world more manageable for them. Create a structured, consistent visual schedule for ERP as routines/rules help children learn what to expect for practice sessions.  Work on one ERP task at a time which helps to reduce stress and prevent refusals. However, be flexible around time as autistic kids have their own timeline and ability to manage sensory overload.  Be proactive and talk through exposures, or role-play exposures before actual ERP practice can be helpful.  Helping children to develop psychological flexibility is key to tolerating change.  As a parent, being flexible when working with an autistic child is also key.",,4.  Structure,/blog/how-to-help-a-child-with-ocd-and-autism,121,8

3881,"Some of my earliest memories are of what I now know to be OCD. I am not sure there was ever a time in my life when it was not there. It is hard to know what was my born personality and what was my illness. Of course, as a child, you accept what is. You don’t question your mind because it’s all you know. Your inner thoughts and feelings are what drive you, what make you who you are.

I wanted to believe that I was “normal” if such a thing existed. But deep down, I knew that something wasn’t right. I was five or six when I had this realization. How and when exactly I knew, I couldn’t tell you. But I knew. ",p, A Childhood Interrupted,/blog/ocd-took-my-childhood-then-gave-me-my-calling,73,8

3927,"Teletherapy has been around for many years, and recently there has been an explosive increase in the use of telehealth services. The ability to access therapy online is not only convenient and time-efficient, but for many, it also opens up the door to specialized treatment that was previously inaccessible. ",p,,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,49,3
3928,"That’s especially true for Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, the gold standard of treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the past, finding a therapist specialized in OCD and ERP had been notoriously difficult – if not almost impossible in some regions, especially in rural areas – given the regional mental health licensing laws and scarcity of ERP-trained providers. ",p,,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,59,3
3929,"This lack of resources has resulted in individuals with OCD either having to travel great distances for treatment, getting treatment from professionals who are not specifically trained to treat OCD (which can actually make OCD worse), or not getting treatment at all. When left untreated, people with OCD are 10 times more likely to die by suicide.  ",p,,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,57,3

3931,"The great news is that in many cases, online therapy for OCD specifically can be more effective than in-person therapy.

3933,"ERP treatment conducted online in a face-to-face environment follows the same evidence-based interventions as ERP treatment conducted in-person, which have been clinically proven to effectively treat OCD. Research has also found therapy administered online to be equally as – and sometimes more – effective as when it is conducted in person. ",p,The Differences Between Online ERP And In-Person ERP,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,51,3
3934,"The greatest difference between ERP therapy in-person versus online is the setting in which the treatment is taking place. In-person, ERP might occur in a therapist’s office with the clinician in the same room. This may seem like a good option, as working with a therapist in a controlled environment can feel safer. People may have thoughts like, “if anything bad happens, I will be okay because I am in a clinical setting,” or, “my therapist would not let any harm come to me.” ",p,The Differences Between Online ERP And In-Person ERP,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,84,5

3936,"Online ERP sessions, however, most frequently occur in the person with OCD’s home or location of choice.

3939,"By contrast, while an in-person therapist will do exposures with a patient, it’ll likely not be the ones the patient needs most, given the travel limitations. The other option is that the in-person therapist might assign the most-needed exposures after a session is completed, at a time when they won’t be present because the setting where the patient has to perform exposures is outside of their office. This means that while sessions themselves are done with the therapist, the actual exposures may need to be done alone by the patient, and the patient then has to describe them after. It’s also difficult for the therapist to know if the patient has properly done response prevention. ",p,What Can Make Online ERP Therapy More Effective?,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,115,5
3940,"For example, an individual with contamination OCD may avoid straightening up their home due to a fear that the items on the ground will contaminate them. With in-person treatment, the ERP therapist would likely give the patient an assignment to clean a portion of their home and then discuss the experience with them during the following session, which could be much later. ",p,What Can Make Online ERP Therapy More Effective?,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,62,3
3941,"An incredible advantage with online treatment is that the patient does not need to complete the exposure on their own, nor does the therapist need to wait until the next session to help the patient make progress. Rather, they can actually be “in the room” with their patient as they expose themselves to their triggers and work on refraining from responding with compulsions. ",p,What Can Make Online ERP Therapy More Effective?,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,63,3
3942,"This is true no matter what the patient’s subtype is or what location is best for their exposures. A person with sexual intrusive thoughts who might normally avoid being in crowded public places for fear of acting out sexually inappropriate behaviors with others might be assigned an exposure to walk around their local mall. With online treatment, the therapist could be “there with them” virtually through the patient’s AirPods. In this way, the therapist is more involved as they face their triggers head-on and would be able to speak with the patient the entire time and guide them through the exposure. ",p,What Can Make Online ERP Therapy More Effective?,/blog/why-online-erp-can-be-more-effective-than-in-person-therapy,101,5

3955,"Pure obsessional obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a subtype of OCD that’s characterized by intrusive thoughts, images or urges without any visible physical compulsions. Pure OCD differs slightly from other types of OCD because its compulsions primarily take place in a person’s head rather than actions. ",p,What is Pure OCD?,/blog/pure-obsessional-ocd,45,3

(It is possible to have pure OCD and experience no compulsions at all — but this is a rarer form of the subtype.) ,,What is Pure OCD?,/blog/pure-obsessional-ocd,61,5
3959,"Many people with pure OCD are terrified of sharing these experiences for fear of being judged. It’s common for people with pure OCD to feel like they are the only ones dealing with this.

3976,"Let’s say that each time you’re driving, you can’t stop seeing mental images of your car running over a pedestrian.

As a way of coping, you’ve started counting to seven in your head each time you see an image like this. This strategy worked at first, but lately it has been less effective.

I just want these images to stop.” But instead of trying to suppress them, a therapist may ask you to put your full attention on these thoughts. This teaches your brain a new response to your intrusive thoughts and shows you that they don’t have to keep you from living your life.  Eventually, you will begin to distinguish yourself from your OCD thoughts, and it will become easier to let them come and go without engaging in compulsions or avoidance. ",p,Examples of ERP OCD exposures,/blog/pure-obsessional-ocd,112,7

These obsessions foster doubts; doubts about whether their thoughts are significant; doubts about who they really are. Doubt is the opposite of certainty.

4103,"#1: Every therapist in our network is both trained and actively mentored by our clinical leadership team, made up of experts and researchers who each have 20+ years of experience serving the OCD community.​​Effective OCD treatment can be complex, so specialized training matters. Our therapists work side-by-side with world-renowned OCD leaders who have designed some of the world’s top OCD treatment programs. These leaders build our protocols at NOCD and actively manage them today, and they conduct rigorous training in OCD and ERP – evidence-based therapy that’s been proven to be the most effective treatment for OCD. All of this ensures that our members get the best care.Additionally, each NOCD therapist receives ongoing clinical mentorship and professional development from our clinical leadership team, which includes weekly sessions and peer collaboration with our network of OCD specialists, one-on-one case consultations, assessments of ERP treatment plans to guarantee efficacy, and more. Learn more about how NOCD drives clinical excellence through training and mentorship. ",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,161,8
4104,"#2: Anyone in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Ontario can access a qualified licensed therapist who specializes in OCD and ERP – no matter where they live, and within days on average instead of months.In the past, finding a therapist specialized in OCD has been notoriously difficult – if not almost impossible in some regions, especially in rural areas – given the state-by-state mental health licensing laws and scarcity of ERP-trained providers. Now, gone are the days where people with OCD can’t access ERP therapy because they live in a region where there aren’t enough licensed therapists that specialize in ERP, or where the specialists don’t have availability for months. As a telehealth service and digital behavioral health platform, NOCD can provide live face-to-face ERP Therapy and always-on support for people with OCD regardless of where they are.When you sign up for NOCD Therapy, our goal is to get you connected with a therapist as soon as possible after signing up. You can guarantee that your licensed therapist is trained in OCD and ERP by our clinical leadership team and is a licensed mental health therapist in your area. We’re even working on further expanding across the globe to help more people.",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,202,12
4105,"#3: Our therapy is 100% online, through face-to-face video sessions. In many cases, online therapy for OCD is more effective than in-person therapy. That’s because your therapist can do exposure exercises with you in the places that trigger your symptoms, so you can confront your fears in the appropriate environment. The greatest difference between ERP therapy in person versus online is the setting in which the treatment is taking place. In person, ERP might occur in a therapist’s office with the clinician in the same room. Online ERP sessions, however, most frequently occur in the member’s home or location of choice. The former may seem like the best option, as having the therapist with you in a controlled environment can feel safer. But the goal of ERP is to confront the fears and anxieties in your daily life, not in the controlled setting of an office. Online ERP therapy also allows the therapist to work with you in settings and situations where your triggers are most likely present — and where obsessions or compulsions are most likely to occur.",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,179,10
4106,"#4: Even when you’re not in a session with your therapist, you’ll always have support from NOCD. You have unlimited access to peer communities and can use self-help tools to practice your exposure exercises more easily, to help you get better. You’ll also be connected with a Personal Peer Advisor – a member of our team who has experienced OCD and completed ERP treatment at NOCD Therapy – and can participate in virtual support groups with other members of the NOCD community.Between sessions is often when people with OCD need help the most, since those are times you’re not working with your therapist and because OCD is chronic. That’s why additional support is available in the NOCD platform through self-help tools, to help with ERP therapy exercises and homework. There are even specific tools for unexpected episodes that you can use any time OCD suddenly strikes.Further, it’s important to feel connected and understood when you have OCD, and to know that you’re not alone. If you need someone to talk to who truly gets you, or if you’re experiencing OCD thoughts that are making you feel isolated, guilty, or ashamed, you can get peer support from members of the NOCD community, virtual support groups, and your personal Peer Advisor.",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,209,9
4107,"#5: Messaging is a key component of the NOCD Therapy experience. If things get tough between sessions, you can message your therapist inside the NOCD platform.We want to be sure that we are available to assist you throughout the therapeutic experience, even when you’re not in a session with your therapist. As you’re on your treatment journey, you can always message your therapist with questions, concerns, or anything you might need. All messaging is done conveniently and confidentially via the NOCD platform. ",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,82,6
4108,"#6: Our goal is to make effective treatment as affordable as possible. NOCD Therapy is covered by many of our members’ insurance plans, and we work with members paying out-of-pocket to manage costs in a way that meets their needs. In the past, ERP therapy has not only been difficult to access because of a shortage of providers who specialize in treating OCD worldwide, but even more so due to the substantial costs of treatment. Working with an ERP-trained therapist could cost $250-350 (or more) per session, and most often, these costs were paid out-of-pocket as ERP has not typically been covered by insurance. NOCD set out to change things and became committed to helping more people start effective treatment without the cost being a barrier. Our members find that their out-of-pocket costs are significantly less than what specialists charge in their area.Additionally, we’ve partnered with many insurance providers – including UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and more – so members can receive OCD treatment through their behavioral health plan benefits. It’s one of the first times that ERP therapy has ever been insurance-backed.",p,,/blog/how-is-nocd-different-from-standard-erp-therapy,188,9

4111,How to Tell if Your Therapist is Making Your OCD Worse,h1,title,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,11,1
4112,"Imagine that you were dealing with chronic stomach aches that were so persistent, you decided to make a doctor’s appointment. Your hope was to alleviate the pain and figure out the root cause. But what if instead of helping, the medical care you received actually increased your pain? Would you keep going to appointment after appointment, see physician after physician, if you just kept feeling worse after? Getting care that’s not helpful can make a person feel resigned to struggle on their own. ",p,,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,83,4
4113,"Now, imagine that the distress wasn’t in your stomach but was in your mind – a tidal wave of anxiety repeatedly slamming into you from the time you woke up until the time you went to bed. You’ve worked with a mental health professional, but your anxiety has only intensified after each appointment. Would you take the risk to keep seeking care?",p,,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,62,3
4114,"This is the dilemma many people with OCD face. OCD usually manifests in the form of sticky, irrational fears that create tremendous and constant distress. When the anxiety becomes overwhelming, people usually seek help from a therapist – often one who is covered by their insurance, which typically means a general therapist. However, most general therapists don’t recognize OCD symptoms, due to widespread misunderstanding and stigma. The result is that these providers give people treatment that’s not just ineffective, but that is actually harmful for OCD – amplifying the mental distress because it’s never treating the root cause. ",p,,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,98,6
4115,"As a result, many people with OCD spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each year on general therapy that causes them to get worse, making them feel apprehensive about seeking any additional help in the future. They may start to think that they are unable to be helped at all, and feel hopeless about ever getting better. Sadly, many people with OCD who are able to find the courage to try a different provider can wind up in the same spot – working with another clinician who is unsure how to treat them and that just makes their symptoms worse. ",p,,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,102,4
4116,"After being repeatedly burned, it’s no wonder people with OCD are hesitant to start treatment. My team and I at NOCD are dedicated to ending this problem, by ensuring that people with OCD can understand not only what good evidence-based treatment looks like as quickly as possible, but also how to avoid potentially harmful treatment that’s not working. ",p,,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,58,3
4117,The signs to look out for,h2,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,6,1
4118,Here are two signs to watch out for that can indicate that your therapist may be making your OCD symptoms worse:,p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,21,1
4119,Sign #1: Your therapist defines your recurring intrusive thoughts- hallmark symptoms of OCD – as “just anxiety.”,p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,17,2
4120,"Symptoms of anxiety and depression commonly co-occur with OCD, and they’re frequently caused by OCD going untreated. According to Dr. Patrick B. McGrath, NOCD’s Chief Clinical Officer, “While it’s technically correct to say that someone suffering with OCD may also have anxiety, the root cause of the suffering is often obsessions that may include themes of guilt, shame, disgust, or other uncomfortable feelings. If you don’t address these concerns it’s tough to make progress clinically.”",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,75,6
4121,"Further, many people with anxiety are given talk therapy, which is proven to make OCD worse. People doing talk therapy for OCD are taught by their therapist to push their thoughts out of their head, which is a compulsive action that makes the thoughts stronger over time. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,47,3
4122,"Here’s a cliche explanation as to why: Imagine telling yourself, “Don’t think of the pink elephant in the room.” What’s the first thing that you’re going to do? You’ll probably think of the pink elephant in the room! OCD works the same way; if you have harm-based intrusive thoughts and tell yourself, “Don’t think about hurting the person who just walked by,” one of the first things that you are likely to do is think about hurting the person walking by. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,81,3
4123,"Therefore, misdiagnosing someone with OCD for “just anxiety” and treating them with generic talk therapy is analogous to picking a weed in a garden while simultaneously watering the root, as opposed to just picking the root. It doesn’t make sense. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,40,3
4124,"That’s why it’s crucial to identify OCD symptoms as soon as possible in the treatment journey. Please do your homework and know what you’re looking for in a prospective therapist to avoid a route of incorrect, or even harmful, treatment. If you’re currently seeing a therapist who you suspect might be treating you incorrectly, I’d strongly encourage you to ask questions as soon as possible. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,65,4
4125,"Sign #2: Your therapist reassures you constantly, saying that your OCD fears aren’t true, and/or instructs you to find the true meaning behind your fears.",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,25,2
4126,"A major difference between general Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy is that general CBT teaches you to challenge your thoughts, whereas ERP teaches you to accept them. The latter is effective for OCD, while the former is not. In one of your first meetings, your therapist should identify having training in ERP and should specify that giving reassurance will be avoided in your sessions. Reassurance is one of the most common safety-seeking behaviors for people with OCD. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,83,5
4127,"Yet, therapists who don’t know how to treat OCD will consistently reassure you. That doesn’t make them bad people, as we’re taught as humans to reassure others when they’re feeling scared – but it certainly makes them unqualified to be your therapist if you have OCD. He or she may be likeable and might develop great rapport with you, but any therapist is paid to ultimately do a job: to help you get better and empower you with the tools needed to maintain your progress long-term. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,86,4
4128,Knowing these two signs should help you find proper care if you or a loved one is struggling with OCD. Getting effective treatment for OCD shouldn’t be trial and error; it should be the expectation. ,p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,35,3
4129,"As a society we aren’t quite there yet, but we have made great strides over the past five years. I believe that one day, people with OCD will be identified and treated within minutes of recognizing their initial symptoms. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,39,3
4130,"Eventually, there will be a healthcare system where every doctor screens for OCD, no matter their specialty, and people get started in evidence-based treatment within mere days after their first OCD symptoms appear. Health insurance networks will be measured by how well they identify and treat people with OCD, creating a process where you won’t need to worry about your therapist’s ability to recognize OCD symptoms. ",p,The signs to look out for,/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-therapist-is-making-your-ocd-worse,66,3

4133,What is Harm OCD?,h2,What is Harm OCD?,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,4,1
4134,"Harm OCD is a common subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that causes intrusive unwanted thoughts, images or urges to harm oneself or others. Thoughts of harm should always be taken seriously, which can make symptoms of harm OCD especially frightening. People with harm OCD are not more likely to harm themselves or others than people with other OCD subtypes. However, they may view their intrusive and unwanted thoughts as an indication of a desire to act. This fuels their anxiety and drives them to engage in various compulsions aimed at eliminating this fear (e.g., removing all sharp objects from their kitchen). ",p,What is Harm OCD?,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,101,8
4135,"OCD tends to fixate on what is most important to an individual. When a person values being caring and responsible above all else, OCD will latch on and cause them to have obsessions and compulsions in opposition to their core values. This makes the doubting thoughts all the more anxiety-provoking (“How can I be absolutely sure I don’t act on the impulse I just had to drop my baby? Do I secretly actually want to hurt him?”). ",p,What is Harm OCD?,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,77,4
4136,Harm OCD symptoms,h2,Harm OCD symptoms,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,3,1
4137,"People with harm OCD generally experience their obsessions and compulsions in two different ways. They either worry that they will harm themselves or someone else by accident, or that they will act on an involuntary impulse or urge to harm themselves or others. In the first scenario, someone may fear they would accidentally leave their stove on and burn the whole building down. They may be afraid to drive because they don’t want to potentially cause an accident. In the second scenario, someone may experience an involuntary impulse to harm another person and be terrified they would actually act on it. (“I just had an image of punching my spouse. It felt so real. I love her more than anything and I would never ever want to act on this. But how can I be certain I won’t?”",,Harm OCD symptoms,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,138,9
4138,"Although it might sound surprising, it is relatively common to have a thought, impulse or urge to harm oneself or someone else, but these thoughts generally only last a few seconds at most. For example, someone might be going about their day and wonder, “What would happen if I put my hand on this burning-hot cooking pan?” When this happens, people will generally think, “That was a weird thought. Definitely a bad idea and not something I want to do,” and forget about it. ",p,Harm OCD symptoms,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,84,4
4139,"However, most people with harm OCD find thoughts like these are impossible to let go of. When someone with harm OCD catches themselves with a thought like this, their OCD latches on and assigns meaning to it. Suddenly, the person will think, “I just had a thought that I wanted to burn myself. That means I do. Otherwise, why did I just think that?” These thoughts can spiral until they feel unbearable. A person might start thinking, “I can’t believe I want to burn myself. Is there something wrong with me? This is terrible. Should I see a doctor?”",p,Harm OCD symptoms,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,99,8

4143,"The best course of treatment for harm OCD, like all types of OCD, is exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. ERP is considered the gold standard for OCD treatment and has been found effective for 80% of people with OCD. The majority of patients experience results within 12 to 20 sessions. As part of ERP therapy, you’ll track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of possible ways to face your fears.  You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions and the accompanying anxiety or discomfort. Exposures will be mindfully created so that you’re gradually building toward your goal rather than moving too quickly and getting completely overwhelmed.",p,Harm OCD ERP therapy ,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,117,7
4144,"The idea behind ERP therapy is that exposure to these thoughts and the discomfort is the most effective way to treat OCD. When you continually submit to the urge to do compulsions, it only strengthens your need to engage them. On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety as you provide yourself with opportunities to change your learning and practice living with uncertainty.",,Harm OCD ERP therapy ,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,87,4
4145,"ERP takes a targeted approach to address your obsessions and compulsions for suicidal OCD. An ERP-trained therapist will help by reviewing which thoughts or scenarios are causing you the most anxiety, avoidance, and compulsions and then work with you to come up with a specialized treatment plan to directly challenge them through gradual, controlled exposure to them. ",p,Harm OCD ERP therapy ,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,57,3

4147,"Rather than trying to make violent intrusive thoughts, images and urges about harming oneself or others go away with compulsive behavior, ERP therapy works to help a person become more comfortable with those thoughts. Or at least more willing to let the thoughts come into their awareness and exist. As a patient becomes more familiar with sitting with these unwanted thoughts without engaging in compulsions or avoidance, the thoughts will often lose the power they had. ",p,Examples of ERP OCD exposures for Harm OCD,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,76,4
4148,"Here’s a specific example. Let’s say someone has continually experienced fears of accidentally hurting someone while driving. It’s never happened before, but the fear of the possibility has become so great that this person no longer feels safe driving. The goal of ERP therapy is to allow this patient to drive again with or without fear. During an ERP session, this patient might practice going for a drive with their therapist. At first, this might feel impossible. They might think, “I want to drive, but I just can’t. I’m too afraid.” ",p,Examples of ERP OCD exposures for Harm OCD,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,91,9
4149,"The patient will work with their therapist to come up with a hierarchy of anxieties and related exposures and gradually work their way through them. For example, they may start with simply sitting in the car during a therapy session and allowing the uncomfortable thoughts and fears to come up.  Instead of trying to reassure themselves, the patient may be asked to lean into uncertainty by repeating a statement like, “I may hurt someone and I may not. It’s impossible to know for sure.” Doing such an exposure contributes to learning and shows the patient that they can tolerate not knowing what will happen as well as the discomfort associated with the thoughts. After repeated exposure with response prevention, the patient may find they are able to drive their car for a short distance, and, eventually, they learn that their feared outcome won’t occur, that they can manage the outcome if it does occur, and that they can tolerate the anxiety or distress that arises when they have intrusive thoughts. In some cases, people find that their anxiety subsides to the point where they no longer experience intense fears of harming someone while on the road. ",,Examples of ERP OCD exposures for Harm OCD,/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype,196,8

4155,"Relationship OCD, or ROCD, is a type of OCD characterized by obsessive, unwanted thoughts about intimate relationships.

Are we compatible enough?",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,48,2

4157,"Valentine’s Day may be an especially tough holiday for people with ROCD. The societal pressure to be in a “perfect” relationship can seem overwhelming in February: we’re surrounded by hearts, candy, greeting cards, and love songs practically everywhere we go. Our friends and family members might be discussing their Valentine’s Day plans or asking about ours. Maybe a partner has high expectations for the holiday.",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,65,5
4158,"Whether you’re single or in a relationship, the thoughts and feelings that come with ROCD might feel so intense in February that you’d rather avoid Valentine’s Day altogether! Avoidance can feel like the best option in the moment. After all, why would you purposefully engage in something that will just make you feel anxious? But avoiding situations that might trigger your obsessions and cause distress is actually counterproductive to OCD recovery, and will only serve in the long term to make symptoms more severe. Instead of avoiding the holiday, try planning and practicing exposures around the things that trigger anxiety—whether or not you have an intimate partner.",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,107,4
4159,"Let’s say you are in some kind of intimate relationship. If ROCD causes you to feel an immense amount of pressure to make the holiday “perfect” for your partner, you might spend days picking out a gift or making a card. This may involve carefully considering the cost, size, and meaning of the present, or repetitive, agitating consideration of whether or not it accurately represents the love you feel (or think you should feel) for your partner.",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,77,4
4160,"You might also feel uncertain about how your partner might have spent Valentine’s Day with someone else in the past, imagining all kinds of scenarios. When the anxiety becomes intolerable, you may ask about the types of gifts they and their former partner exchanged or the activities they engaged in. It can feel impossible not to compare this to your relationship. Was that other person better than me? Did my partner love them more? Have they had more intimate experiences with another partner than with me? As the questions swirl, you might feel like asking your partner for reassurance in order to just get rid of the anxiety for a while.",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,111,5
4161,"Instead of giving into this pressure from OCD to seek reassurance, try using these kinds of situations as inspiration for doing exposures. Try limiting the amount of time you spend picking out a restaurant to fifteen minutes, and draw a picture or imagine a scenario in which your partner doesn’t like the restaurant you chose. What would this feel like? What might the consequences be? Write out the worst-case scenario and read it out loud a few times. Leaning into your thoughts can feel scary in the moment, but it is the basis for effective exposure and response prevention (ERP).

4162,"It’s easy to forget this on Valentine’s Day, but people without intimate partners are often just as deeply engaged in romantic rumination. You might see couples walking around, doing the things intimate partners are supposed to be doing, and start to wonder why you’re not in a similar kind of situation. For people with ROCD, these feelings of loneliness and sadness can prompt an onslaught of obsessive thoughts: What if I’m not good enough? How can I be sure that I’ll have something like this one day too?",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,88,3
4163,"Because these kinds of thoughts tend to produce a lot of distress, people with OCD turn to compulsions. These behaviors can be a bit sneaky: maybe you find pictures of people on social media and wonder why they have partners while you don’t; maybe you tell friends and family that you think you’ll be alone forever in the hope that they’ll say otherwise. ",p,,/blog/when-rocd-tries-to-ruin-your-valentines-day,63,3
4164,"No matter what the compulsion, exposing yourself to thoughts and worries and sitting with the discomfort that comes from them can help you feel better long-term, not just on February 14.

4169,How to lovingly detach from our child’s OCD and anxiety,h1,title,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,10,1
4170,"As a parent, one of the most difficult things we may go through is watching our kids struggle. For children with anxiety and/or OCD, the temptation to rescue and reassure them through their uncertainties can be strong and difficult to withstand. We know how difficult anxiety and OCD can be to live with, so the idea of detaching from our children’s symptoms is understandably difficult and may even feel cold at times. However, we ultimately want our children to be able to learn and understand that they can tolerate uncertainty and discomfort and that compulsions are not only unnecessary, but actually escalate anxiety. In order to do this, we must do our best to not get involved in their reassurance-seeking behavior so we can reinforce the message that reassurance is not needed. ",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,132,6
4171,"In order to work toward a loving detachment from your child’s OCD and anxiety, it is important to remember that detaching doesn’t mean that you don’t care; it is not equivalent to ignoring your child altogether. When your child was a toddler, you probably learned early on that if you gave in to temper tantrums, you only reinforced the idea that a tantrum would lead to a desired outcome. So, as difficult as it may have been, you likely learned that you had to ignore the tantrum in order to teach your toddler how to cope with difficult feelings. As a result, your toddler learned how to deal with disappointment and the frustration of not getting their way. It didn’t mean that you ignored your toddler. You likely still made sure they were safe and gently reinforced your expectations. Eventually, your toddler learned to cope with unwanted feelings and the tantrums faded, but your toddler did not receive the message that you didn’t care. ",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,164,8
4172,"The same can be true when you see your child actively becoming anxious or engaging in compulsive behavior. Disengaging and detaching from the reassurance-seeking behavior doesn’t mean that you don’t care and doesn’t have to involve completely ignoring your child. Just as you once reminded them that throwing a tantrum would not help them get what they want, you can also remind them now that seeking reassurance will only continue to make their anxiety and compulsive behavior worse. You can empathize with their discomfort without reassuring them or rescuing them, knowing that you are helping them work toward being able to tolerate uncertainty more effectively and without the need to engage in a compulsion. ",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,114,5
4173,"Another step to help you lovingly detach from your child’s OCD and anxiety is to separate empathy from reassurance. For example, when your child with social anxiety is questioning whether or not they are accepted by their peers or questioning how others perceive them, you can still offer empathy without reassuring. Empathy may sound like “making friends can be difficult. It’s impossible to know for sure what other people think about you, so dwelling on it doesn’t seem to be very helpful. But, I understand that it’s natural to feel curious about it sometimes.” Unhelpful reassurance may sound like “of COURSE they like you! Why wouldn’t they??” The former response is detaching from the anxiety enough that you are not giving in to reassurance, while the latter response is feeding reassurance and ultimately reinforcing the anxiety regarding others’ acceptance. The latter statement may be more tempting, and may provide more comfort to your child. However, the next time they become anxious regarding others’ perception of them, they are going to search for that same relieving reassurance instead of learning to tolerate that uncertainty and then let it go. ",,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,188,9
4174,"For your child who obsesses over safety, empathy may sound like, “I can tell that you are really worried we forgot to lock the door and that this is hard on you. We are not going to turn around and check. Let’s talk about the fun we’re going to have at the birthday party”, while unhelpful reassurance might be, “I promised I locked the door, I remember specifically locking it. Do you want to call the neighbors to check for us?” With the former statement, you are not completely ignoring your child’s struggles, you’re just choosing not to become emotionally involved in order to eliminate the struggle. It is important to remember that each time you choose to eliminate your child’s anxiety, you only reinforce the idea that anxiety and uncertainty is something that your child cannot learn how to cope with. Our children look to us as an example of how to respond to the world. Detaching from the anxiety and OCD will help set the example for your child that the thing they are worried about/obsessing over is not a true threat. If they can accept that it is not a true threat, it will become easier for them to accept the uncertainty that they are currently attempting to alleviate.  ",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,212,9
4175,"As parents, keeping our own emotions in check will be an essential part of lovingly detaching. When your child comes to you worried that he gave a presentation at school and another student may have been laughing, do you find yourself becoming defensive for your child and wanting to protect him? How will this influence your response? If your response is full of anger and disgust, what message will you be sending your child regarding how much emphasis he should place on others’ perception of him? Even though being a parent inevitably involves becoming emotionally involved in virtually every aspect of your child’s life, we have to keep in mind how our emotions may inadvertently feed anxiety and OCD. If you want your child to be able to dismiss the uncertainty of what other kids may think of him, you have to also accept that same uncertainty with a sense of neutrality; we won’t ever know for sure whether or not another student was laughing at his expense, so what can we do with that uncertainty? We set the example of how to accept that we don’t know for sure, empathize that it is difficult to present in front of others, and then choose to move on to something else without ruminating over it. Essentially, you, as the parent, are setting that example of remaining grounded and calm in the face of uncertainty. ",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,233,5
4176,"This leads us to our final suggestion of how to lovingly detach from your child’s OCD and anxiety: the art of redirection. Your child will need help and guidance as they learn to break the cycle of rumination and compulsive behaviors. Redirection provides a more effective alternative to the temptation to reassure. Can you start a conversation about something else? Can you remind them about upcoming activities/plans? Although it is important for your child to feel some degree of anxiety and discomfort associated with uncertainty in order to accept difficult feelings and learn to tolerate them, it is also important to help provide them with a skill that will keep them from ruminating. Learning to tolerate and accept a difficult feeling does not have to equal suffering, and teaching them to redirect and do something else will not only help your child, but it will also help you to detach from the anxiety.",p,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,153,6
4177,"As parents, we know the importance of communicating to our children that we believe in them. The same is true while they are learning to cope with uncertainty and uncomfortable emotions. They can tolerate these emotions without being rescued. If we want our child to believe that this is possible, we have to actually demonstrate that we believe it is possible. So, we must choose to consistently show that the thing the are worried about… we are not worried about it. We communicate this by detaching from their anxiety and compulsions. We love them and are not abandoning them or leaving them, but we are not engaging with the anxiety and OCD. Just like when they were toddlers and their brains eventually learned to cope with not getting their way, their brains are capable of learning to cope with and dismiss uncertainty without becoming so distressed. When our children look to us for reassurance, it may be so tempting to provide that reassurance just to see their anxiety begin to alleviate. However, what message are we sending them when we do this? That reassurance-seeking is the answer whenever they become anxious or uncertain in the future? That we support and agree with seeking reassurance as an appropriate response? In order to break this debilitating cycle, we must instead communicate that whatever uncertainty they are experiencing can be tolerated and that when we all stop feeding it, it will inevitably begin to shrink and dissipate. A loving detachment will help with this process. ",,,/blog/how-to-lovingly-detach-from-our-childs-ocd-and-anxiety,252,12
4178,My Decision to Specialize in OCD Came From My Own Experience,h1,title,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,11,1
4179,I can vividly recall the event that led to me finally getting help for what I later learned was OCD. I was an undergrad. I was standing on top of a multi-story building and I had no idea what was going on inside my head.,p,,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,45,4
4180,"For me, OCD has often been very visual. At that time, I had mental images of harming myself. At this particular moment, I had a mental image of jumping off the edge of the building, falling through the air, and hitting the pavement below. I could see it all so vividly. It was powerful and frightening. I’d been diagnosed with depression some years before and started to wonder if I must want to harm myself, even though I didn’t feel that way. ",p,,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,82,7
4181,"After about two or three days of struggling with this distressing visualization, I started to think that there must be a part of me that wanted to kill myself. I went to the counselor’s office at my university. I had just enough psych classes under my belt to articulate what I thought was going on. I told them that I needed to talk to someone about suicidal ideation, which simply means thinking about suicide or wanting to take your own life.",p,,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,81,5
4182,"The counselor told me point blank that he’d hospitalized people who’d come in with suicidal thoughts or imagery. The only reason he didn’t hospitalize me was that the psychology program I was in had given me the vocabulary to provide him with a little more context. I was able to convey that while these images of my suicide were intense and coming up frequently, I didn’t want to do it and didn’t have a plan to do it. ",p,,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,78,4
4183,"However, because I’d mentioned thoughts of suicide, the person I spoke with wanted someone to see me immediately.  Within a week of being assessed, I met with another counselor. Initially, he did talk therapy. But after about two or three weeks of sessions, that person identified what was going on as OCD. ",p,,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,52,5

4185,"As a teen, I’d known some people who had OCD, but their experience looked very different from mine, so I didn’t make the connection. Nevertheless, the diagnosis came as a relief. It gave me a different lens through which I could interpret my behaviors. As I learned more about how the OCD brain works, I acknowledged that I was having upsetting intrusive thoughts, but that didn’t mean that I was likely to act on them.”In fact, was probably  less likely that I would act on them than if I had those same thoughts but didn’t have OCD. That’s because OCD latches onto an outcome that you really don’t want. ",p,Realizing That it Was OCD,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,109,7
4186,"The university had a pretty strict limit on how many times you could see a counselor, and so, after a few weeks, I was transferred to someone else. That person used a form of the gold-standard treatment for OCD: exposure and response prevention therapy. It works by exposing people to the triggers that provoke their obsessions, habituating them to the discomfort they feel so that they no longer need to respond by performing a compulsion. ",p,Realizing That it Was OCD,/blog/my-decision-to-specialize-in-ocd-came-from-my-own-experience,75,4
4187,"The ERP that other therapists and I use at NOCD is more structured, targeted, and robust than the type that I was treated with. I was treated with exposures I was asked to imagine.

Being both a counselor and a person who received counseling, I know that people with OCD can respond very quickly to behavioral interventions. OCD treatment typically yields very tangible progress, pretty consistently.

4198,"Sometimes, people express concern that ERP won’t be enough to make a significant difference.

4202,Why ERP is Effective for POCD,h1,title,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,6,1
4203,"Images of yourself engaging in abhorrent acts. Questions like, “What if I actually wanted to do this?” Doubts about interactions you might have had with children. Thoughts of being doomed to a solitary life because somehow you feel convinced that you are a danger to children. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,46,4
4204,"These are just some of the obsessions that individuals with pedophilia OCD might experience. Pedophilia OCD, or POCD, a subtype of OCD, is characterized by the presence of unwanted thoughts, images, and/or urges of a sexual nature related to children as well as behaviors intended to decrease the distress caused by these thoughts, images, and urges. People with POCD are distinctly different from pedophiles in that these thoughts are morally repugnant to them. Unlike pedophiles, who fantasize about sexual interactions with children (and find these fantasies pleasurable), people with POCD experience these thoughts like a relentless horror film on repeat in their mind. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,103,5
4205,"Unfortunately, POCD is often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. The sense of shame that surrounds this particular subtype can discourage people with these obsessions from seeking treatment. Even when they are in treatment, individuals might be scared to fully disclose their obsessions due to fears that they will be reported to law enforcement or that their children will be taken from them, for example. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,62,4
4206,"In reality, POCD is treatable just like any other subtype of OCD, with exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. It could be helpful to think of ERP as a tool that can be used for all OCD subtypes. The way the tool is used might differ depending on the theme of obsessions, but the principles remain the same: purposely approach things that bring on obsessional distress and actively resist engaging in any behaviors — both overt and covert — that aim to reduce that obsessional distress. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,86,4
4207,"For individuals with POCD, this might look like: ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,8,1
4208,"Just like with other forms of OCD, response prevention is the secret sauce that makes ERP so effective. For individuals with POCD, their compulsions might look less like what people traditionally think of when they imagine compulsions (e.g. overt repetitive behaviors) and more like excessive worrying. For example, someone with POCD might spend hours trying to come up with proof that they would never hurt a child, or they might try to think about all the ways they can keep themselves far from children in the future. They might spend sleepless nights wondering when they will feel better or how they can properly pay for the mental crime of having these thoughts in the first place. Individuals with POCD might distance themselves from others, particularly the children in their families, in order to prevent their worst fears from coming true. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,140,8
4209,"With ERP, these individuals would work to reduce and eliminate these dysfunctional anxiety reduction strategies. It is important to step back from the content of the OCD and recognize that, at its core, OCD is fear of the unknown, whether it is the unknown of the past, or the unknown of the future. In ERP treatment, individuals with POCD practice accepting that predicting or trying to control the future with 100% certainty, as well as having 100% certainty about the past, is impossible. They purposely resist any attempts to “figure it out” as they remind themselves that these attempts are running toward a moving finish line. They practice acknowledging the difference between possibility and probability, between thoughts and actions, between feeling like they cannot tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity and experiencing, through exposure and response prevention, that they can. ",p,,/blog/erp-is-effective-for-pocd,138,6
4210,"In these ways, ERP treatment for POCD is no different than ERP for any other OCD subtype. ERP treatment provides hope to people with OCD. At the beginning of treatment, individuals with OCD might feel like they are powerless. They might feel like their lives are being held hostage by OCD, like they have somehow forever lost the person that they were before these awful thoughts took hold. ERP, by encouraging people to face their fears and change their behavioral and cognitive responses to these fears, is like going headfirst through a dark tunnel.

4234,"Although the severity of these symptoms, and how they manifest, can vary widely from person to person, if you have OCD you’re likely to feel very overwhelmed or drained from your symptoms. OCD can take up hours of your days, even carrying over into the night, and causing issues with falling asleep, staying asleep or having bad nightmares related to your obsession.",p,OCD during the day and the night,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,62,3

4237,"It has been scientifically proven that OCD patients have more trouble sleeping than people who do not have OCD, whether it’s falling asleep or staying asleep undisturbed. A Swedish study from 2020 measured that obsessive-compulsive patients were almost seven times more likely to be diagnosed with or treated for insomnia too, compared to people without the disorder. ",p,The basics: How OCD affects your sleep,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,57,3
4238,"If you have OCD you may have a hard time getting to bed because you may be constantly getting up to check something or perform a compulsion. Once in bed, you may have a hard time drifting off because your mind is fixated on obsessions that are making you anxious, worried and stressed. Once asleep, you may be disturbed by nightmares or very vivid intrusive thoughts during the night, and these may leave you feeling uneasy or wake you up. Several studies have also shown that the more severe the OCD symptoms are during the day, the more severe the sleep disturbance and insomnia can be.",p,The basics: How OCD affects your sleep,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,106,5
4239,"One study speculated that there might be a slight difference between the subtypes of OCD one can manifest and how much they affect your sleep — but this, like most aspects of this condition, can be highly subjective, and there isn’t a one-size-fits-all conclusion. ",p,The basics: How OCD affects your sleep,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,44,2
4240,"A significant element that may be affecting your sleep, according to researchers, is the presence of “sibling conditions” associated with OCD (you may sometimes hear them described as “comorbid”), such as depression and anxiety. In some cases there can be an independent relationship between depression, anxiety and sleep, and in some studies OCD patients who do not have comorbid diagnoses don’t have as much trouble sleeping as OCD patients who do. In other cases the obsessions alone could be causing your sleep troubles. So it’s likely a combination of these conditions put together that are affecting your sleep cycle.",p,The basics: How OCD affects your sleep,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,99,5

4242,"Once again, clinical research on this area of OCD is still quite preliminary, and there isn’t much of a clean-cut answer. There just haven’t been enough studies with concrete results that can prove (or discredit!) relationships between OCD and nightmares, and clinicians are still mainly collecting clinical and anecdotal evidence about this topic. ",p,So will OCD make you have nightmares? Maybe. ,/blog/will-ocd-make-you-have-nightmares,53,3
4243,"In some studies, patients with OCD have much worse nightmares than patients without it, and getting consistent treatment decreases the negative content of dreams over time. In others there isn’t that big of a difference and all patients report very anxious nightmares, and in others there is no link at all between OCD and nightmares. There may be some  anecdotal stories of people having OCD related nightmares or doing compulsions during dreams, but there is no straightforward answer because everybody experiences OCD in slightly different ways.",p,So will OCD make you have nightmares?

4249,"Every day, from the time I wake up to the time I finally go to bed, I’m overwhelmed by disturbing thoughts that I don’t want to have. They’re usually about things that matter a lot to me, and I’ve started doing specific things (sometimes over and over) just to make sure the thoughts won’t come true.

You just want to fly through your homework and go spend time with your friends, but your mom reminds you that you still have to clean your room. You’re not going to convince her, so you’ll do it as quickly as possible.

Your stomach feels sick, you’re getting dizzy, and you feel like you just have to tell someone about the thought. But it’s a crazy thought, and you know it, so you don’t tell anyone. You put everything back on the floor and try again. You fold your green shirt, and then the blue one, and finally the red.

4254,"This isn’t an extreme case meant to shock you. It’s adapted from a real patient’s story, and it’s typical of the condition. In this case, the first intrusive thought is, “My sister is going to die unless I do this right.” The obsessions come next: “Oh god, this means I really do have to get this right.” The bodily distress coincides with the obsessions, and the two build on one another to become seemingly unbearable. Then, to protect the sister and get rid of distress, the compulsion: folding things in a specific way. Although the logic of our world doesn’t suggest any connection between folding clothes and a sister’s wellbeing, the logic of this person’s mind tells them it does.

4255,"Instead of focusing on school, work, family, friends, health or recreation, people with OCD end up spending their time and energy on compulsions. Most of them know this behavior is illogical, but this doesn’t convince their brain that it can take a break and stop seeking certainty all the time. That’s why explaining to someone with OCD that their actions are irrational probably isn’t doing them any good.

4256,"OCD can wreak havoc on every part of someone’s life. It doesn’t help that the people around them misunderstand their symptoms, calling them control freaks, neat freaks, obsessive, “sort of OCD” or whatever else. As it turns out, people with OCD don’t really want control (in the form of neatness, or cleanliness, or whatever else).

For most of us, these thoughts seem “messed up” or funny, because they’re so out of place.

Unable to feel like their thoughts are just thoughts, people with OCD develop a strong distress response — their mind and body go on high alert. Tolerating this distress is extremely difficult, so people feel the need to do something about the thoughts.

4308,"Over time, you spend more time deciphering your relationship to reassure yourself that you’re still in love than actually enjoying it, ultimately creating an unhealthy situation that drives your loved one away. You try to stop searching for answers, but the anxiety only increases since it’s difficult to accept the uncertainty surrounding the manifestation of love. It’s a vicious, lose-lose situation that people with OCD know all too well. ",p,,/blog/how-to-explain-what-living-with-ocd-feels-like-to-friends-family,69,4
4309,"The main parallel observed among the three situations is that people with OCD typically know that their fear is irrational, but part of their brain still responds as though it were completely rational. This makes it hard for people with OCD to discern fact from fiction, ultimately leading to more doubt and anxiety. ",p,,/blog/how-to-explain-what-living-with-ocd-feels-like-to-friends-family,53,3
4310,"The cause is actually neurological, believed to be due to environmental and genetic factors. With appropriate treatment though, people can rewire their brain’s structure due to its plasticity. That’s why many people with OCD achieve life-changing recovery in just a short amount of time. When doing therapy, brain regions actually change shape, activity levels, and how connected they are with other regions, and people stop feeling as if their emotional and logical gears are out of sync, since they learn how to accept uncertainty. ",p,,/blog/how-to-explain-what-living-with-ocd-feels-like-to-friends-family,84,5

4317,"The hallmark of this OCD subtype is uncertainty — people with religious OCD want to be absolutely certain that they are good and will not be condemned to Hell. However, because no one can be sure about something of that nature, uncertainty breeds fear and anxiety that results in compulsions to alleviate the distress. With religious OCD, the compulsions may look like excessive prayer, confession, reassurance seeking, avoidance of certain actions or people and more.",p,,/blog/religious-scrupulosity-ocd-exposures-explanation-examples,75,4

I prayed to God so I wouldn’t be sent to Hell. No matter how many times I pray to God, I can never know if I will be damned to Hell. I can live my life virtuously, in His image and still not know if at the end of my life I will be able to join my loved ones in heaven. Nothing I do will ever convince me that I will be saved.

4331,How OCD Can Derail College Life,h1,title,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,6,1
4332,The following is a transcript of a video. The text below has been lightly edited for clarity. ,p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,17,3
4333,OCD can have a big impact on the life of college students. Let me tell you about some examples of what I’ve personally seen in treatment of individuals who were at college or university.,p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,34,3
4334,"One person was kicked out of his dormitory because he had a form of OCD called religious scrupulosity. He had a fear that he might do something morally or ethically wrong, and he could go to hell. He had been to a campus religious group early in the day, and when he came back to his dorm room, he decided that he wanted to be saved. So he did what he needed to do: He uttered from his lips, “Jesus my Lord and Savior.”",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,84,5
4335,"And then [he] doubted if God had heard him, so he said it a little bit louder. And then, louder again, and [he] kept doubting if he had done it correctly, to the point that he was in the hall screaming it at the top of his lungs, and campus security was called and took him to the hospital because they feared that he was going psychotic. ",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,67,3
4336,"I’ve also seen individuals who can’t leave their dorm room because the hall of the dorm is just too overwhelming and too dirty. There’s too many people out there. There’s too many chances to get contaminated or to contaminate someone. So, they skip all of their classes, and they don’t leave their dorm room, and that has led them to fail out of college. ",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,64,5
4337,"Other individuals who have been afraid to even walk across campus or take the bus on campus, depending on the size of the campus, because they fear, “What if I were to harm someone while doing that?” One woman was afraid that she had stabbed someone on the bus, right before one of the sessions she had with me. Even though she didn’t have a knife with her,  she feared, “What if I did it, and what if I threw the knife away, and now someone’s been stabbed and I, I got away with it, and they’re harmed, and it’s my fault and, and I’ve ruined their college career and maybe someday there’ll be a video that will come up, and it will find me and show me that I did [it]?” ",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,132,2
4338,"OCD can cause roommates to have a very significant difficult time living with each other. If one roommate is more stereotypical of what some people might think of as OCD, being very clean and orderly and the other roommate is not, that can cause a lot of arguments or fights between them.",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,52,3
4339,"We also know that there are people with OCD who will suffer silently. They may look on the surface as if they’re functioning well, but they’re not sleeping. They’re having trouble getting their work done. There are people who won’t even get work done because their work has to be done perfectly. If they don’t do it perfectly they can’t turn it in. They may get to a point where they’re failing out of their classes for not having turned in any assignments, though they had every intention to do so they just couldn’t bring themselves to finally turn it in because it wasn’t quite right yet, it wasn’t just right, or it wasn’t good enough or even perfect enough for them to do, which could cause them to fail out of school totally. ",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,134,7
4340,"Though many of our college students are young, between 17 and 23 years old, OCD can have [a] significant impact on their lives, and can lead them to have a very difficult experience at college, living in a dorm, or even as a commuter student as well. ",p,,/blog/ocd-can-derail-college-life,47,2

4360,"Perhaps one of the least talked about topics surrounding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is “unacceptable” or taboo thoughts. OCD involves repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts that are hard to control. It also involves compulsions, which can be external or internal. Compulsions are repetitive physical or mental behaviors that a person with OCD uses to neutralize the anxiety and distress caused by intrusive thoughts or in an attempt to prevent something frightening or bad from happening. ",p,,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,73,5
4361,"The topics or themes of OCD intrusive thoughts vary from person to person, although most people experience many themes. This can include unwanted thoughts that they may consider “unacceptable,” “forbidden,” or otherwise prohibited by the individual. These types of taboo thoughts often include harmful, violent, aggressive, sexual, or religious thoughts that are in opposition to their value system and morals, and they often bring about intense feelings of discomfort, shame, or guilt. These thoughts are often hard for people to talk about. ",p,,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,82,5
4362,"What is defined as “unacceptable” or taboo can be based on many factors, such as where the person comes from, how they were raised, perceived social norms, or their religious beliefs. Regardless of these factors, the thoughts are seen as unacceptable by the person suffering from them. We know that intrusive OCD thoughts are ego-dystonic, meaning that the thoughts go against a person’s nature, which is why they are so anxiety-provoking. The things that the person with OCD gets stuck on are the very things that they find disgusting and horrifying.",p,,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,91,5

4365,"OCD themes like POCD,  Sexual Orientation (SO-OCD), Pure O, Harm OCD, Scrupulosity OCD, and others often involve taboo intrusive thoughts that can manifest differently for every person struggling with them. But, at their core they all have a commonality: they cause the person experiencing them to deeply doubt themselves. OCD needs certainty, demanding to know that the thoughts a person is experiencing are not real. OCD looks for their values and then attacks them, causing them to mistrust the very things that they stand for and want in life. It calls into question who they really are and the things they hold most dear.

4367,"Andrea is a new mom to a beautiful baby girl. She has wanted a child her entire life and comes from a large family herself. When she was younger, she was diagnosed with OCD and treated for primarily religious scrupulosity concerns. She worried a lot about going to hell and whether she was sinning. Her symptoms had been mostly under control for many years with an occasional intrusive thought that she easily brushed off. That changed when she brought home her precious new baby.",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,84,7
4368,"The shift happened almost overnight. Andrea wasn’t sleeping much and was stressed as she maneuvered her new role as a mother. One day while giving her daughter a bath she had a frightening intrusive thought that she had molested her. She knew that she had no desire to do this, but she just couldn’t shake the feeling that she may have touched her inappropriately. She would never want to hurt her child, and she never experienced sexual arousal from children before. But what if she did? She just couldn’t be “sure.”",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,91,7
4369,"For the next week, she remained steadfast in solving this problem. She replayed the bath time over and over in her mind. She started making excuses to not change her baby’s diaper and had her mom come and stay with her to help out. She just wanted her mom there so she wouldn’t be alone with her baby. The shame weighed heavily on her heart: What kind of mother was she? What would other people think if they knew? How could she be a mother with these thoughts? ",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,88,5
4370,"Unfortunately, like so many others who have OCD, Andrea was unaware that these terrifying unwanted thoughts were also OCD. Even though she thought she knew what OCD was, and despite having been diagnosed with it in the past, she didn’t know that intrusive thoughts could take on other forms than what she had previously experienced. ",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,55,3
4371,"Andrea was suffering in silence. The truth is that she loved this baby more than anything and was highly unlikely to act on any thoughts of harming her child. She was so hyper-aware of her every move, and so careful to not do anything inappropriate, that the last thing she would engage in would be sexually deviant behavior with her child. ",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,61,4
4372,"Eventually, Andrea decided to seek the help she desperately needed and began exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. She learned that her brain was “getting stuck” on these thoughts. She was able to see the difference between what she thought and how she responded, and that these were not the same. The thoughts did not indicate in any way that she was a dangerous pedophile. She learned to sit in the uncertainty and accept that the thoughts may be there from time to time, but she wouldn’t need to engage them. She wouldn’t even need to solve the “why” of them being there—there was no reason other than she has OCD and sometimes people have unwanted thoughts. With the right tools in place, she went on to enjoy being a mother again. At times when she would have intrusive thoughts, she no longer had to avoid her child or perform compulsions to feel better, and she learned that the distress went away on its own eventually.",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,166,9
4373,"As Andrea learned, in OCD treatment, OCD specialists don’t want to reassure people about their fears. What I mean by this is that we don’t want to ensure them that they will never do something. This is because we know that this temporary reassurance will not last. It may help at the moment to reduce panicked feelings, but ultimately you cannot give OCD “enough” reassurance. It will always want more. At the same time, early in treatment, I think it is important that people with OCD understand what OCD truly looks like and how it works. It’s important to know that OCD latches onto the very things that go against their values. Knowing these things will help them to recognize the symptoms early on and treat them effectively. Then, we work on other strategies together to cope with the distress OCD causes, without providing reassurance or engaging in other safety-seeking behaviors.",p,Examples of “unacceptable” or taboo intrusive thoughts,/blog/do-you-have-unacceptable-unwanted-thoughts-you-are-not-alone,151,10

You can learn that although it may not be comfortable, you can tolerate the distress that even the most taboo thoughts cause. Eventually, the feelings of anxiety do pass. When you don’t give in to rituals or compulsions, your brain relearns that there was no danger in the first place, thus correcting the faulty alarm we have in our brains.

Obsessions cause people with OCD to engage in compulsions in an attempt to get rid of anxiety, eliminate uncertainty, or solve a perceived problem.

Such obsessions often take the form of very vivid images of physical or sexual harm or even the infant’s death, by accident or from intentionally harming your baby. The thoughts or images can appear suddenly and without warning and are extremely upsetting to the person experiencing them. Obsessions also sometimes present as concerns about a safety-oriented task, like having left the door unlocked; intense, gripping fears about germs and contamination; a pressing, driving need to get everything perfect, or a need for symmetry or order. It’s important to note that people who have perinatal OCD and experience thoughts of harming their child are horrified by these thoughts, and are not at risk for actually following through and harming their child, unlike those who are experiencing psychotic delusions. These thoughts and feelings are very upsetting, but are not indicative that the person experiencing them will not actually cause their child any harm.",p,Obsessive Thinking,/blog/perinatal-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-of-harming-my-child,165,7

4449,"It is very common to feel anxiety, guilt, sadness, and other negative emotions as a result of these thoughts, and to try to “fix” or ward them off with compulsive behaviors. While all parents worry about their children and think about, for example, harm coming to them, new parents who are incapable of turning off these thoughts may be experiencing serious anxiety, a common symptom of perinatal OCD. If you have heightened anxiety, your thoughts may leap from one to another and spiral out into catastrophic thinking. For instance, “If the baby doesn’t latch right, she’ll be underweight, and if she’s underweight, her brain won’t develop right, and if her brain doesn’t develop right…” If you have a thought about accidentally shaking your baby, that can lead to thoughts about intentionally doing so, and feeling wracked with guilt for it, despite having not actually done anything at all other than take good care of your child. As mentioned, other OCD symptoms might not involve intrusive thoughts of harm happening to your child but can be equally distressing, such as concerns about contamination or the need for order or symmetry (ref).",p,Anxiety and other distressing emotions,/blog/perinatal-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-of-harming-my-child,190,6

Pediatricians, OBGYN’s, and primary care physicians may be able to recognize symptoms of perinatal OCD, but for treatment it’s best to talk to a mental health clinician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of OCD. An important time of effective therapy to ask your treatment providers about is ERP, or Exposure and Response Prevention, a type of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). ERP is a form of therapy in which you are exposed to your triggers—with a therapist present, at first—and make active choices not to engage in the compulsive behaviors you usually use to make them feel better. While this type of therapy may be anxiety-inducing at first, when you start to have control over your compulsions, there is typically a major drop in anxiety. This type of therapy is a first-line treatment for OCD, as are medications (ref), and has been shown to be very effective for treating OCD—both perinatal OCD and other forms, as well. It can feel scary to engage in, but it is a proven, safe way to retrain your brain and teach it to challenge your triggers. ",p,Take Action,/blog/perinatal-ocd-intrusive-thoughts-of-harming-my-child,209,8

Compulsions are often performed to gain a sense of control over one’s obsessions and possible foreboding events, but these actions typically only offer temporary relief. Understandably, it can be extremely frustrating to feel a lack of control in life and to feel as if something terrible is always around the corner.

4496,"Despite increased awareness about OCD in recent years, many OCD subtypes are still under-recognized. This means that many folks never see their particular distress in the descriptions of OCD they encounter, and thus are never able to seek help. Often, these are the more “taboo” or less well-understood subtypes—things like POCD, Suicidal OCD, or Sensorimotor OCD. And within these subtypes, there are some areas that are even further less recognized. This brings us to bisexuality and sexual orientation OCD (SO-OCD).",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,80,6
4497,"Outdated definitions of SO-OCD described it as fearing you might be gay when you’re not (its old name was actually Homosexuality OCD, or HOCD). Thanks to progress on queer issues, it’s now usually described as fearing you might be gay or straight when you’re not. But not everyone is gay or straight, and it’s still extremely hard to find anything on SO-OCD that discusses sexualities under the bi umbrella, such as bisexuality, pansexuality, omnisexuality, and polysexuality. And that’s a problem.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,80,5
4498,"More than half of all LGBT+ people are bisexual, but due to biphobia and bi erasure both inside and outside the queer community, bi+ people often experience increased invalidation (and crucially to this topic, self-doubt) about their sexuality. This can have devastating effects on mental health: a 2017 review of 52 studies found bisexual people had higher rates of depression and anxiety than those who identified as straight or gay, and The Trevor Project found the same for feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of suicide.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,85,3
4499,"This can make it really, really complicated for bi+ people with OCD. With 85% of bi+ people having experienced identity invalidation, it can be hard for us to tell the difference between SO-OCD and the very real impact of repeated biphobia and bi erasure, especially when it’s coming from within the queer community. It’s not always as clear-cut as thinking you might be gay when you’re really straight, or vice versa—of the few stories I found online on this topic, most involved bi+ people experiencing SO-OCD doubts about the legitimacy of their actual, genuine bisexuality. The extreme amount of self-doubt and imposter syndrome experienced by many bi+ people (even those without OCD) is an easy target for SO-OCD. And the lack of SO-OCD resources that cover bisexuality doesn’t help.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,129,6
4500,"In an effort to counter this, I’ve read everything I could find on the internet about bisexuality and SO-OCD, as well as interviewed other bi+ people with OCD, and I’ve assembled this list of facts and tips:",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,37,1
4501,"1. Biphobia actually demands certainty in a very similar way to OCD. Take the “pick a side” narrative, where bi+ people are told that if we start dating someone, we’ve “picked a side” and must really be straight or gay. We’re also often told outright to stop being bi+ and “pick a side” (none of which makes sense, because nonbinary folks exist, too). The natural fluidity of bisexuality is often perceived negatively by society, which makes it super easy for our OCD to latch onto. It’s a need for certainty double-whammy!",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,91,6
4502,"2. SO-OCD can hit bi+ people at all stages of exploring their sexuality. That means “out” bi+ people who were secure in their bisexuality before SO-OCD hit, people who are still in the closet or questioning if they’re bi+, and everyone in between. And of course, people with other sexualities can also develop SO-OCD about being bi+ as well.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,59,5
4503,"3. For bi+ people, SO-OCD isn’t always a fear of being wrong about one’s sexuality. It can be the fear of being an imposter or not really “queer enough” to count, and it can also be the fear of losing attraction to one or more genders, even if you would still technically be bi+. This anxiety often manifests as a fear that a bi+ person is no longer attracted to the gender of the person they are currently in a relationship with. This makes sense: OCD loves higher stakes targets, and the stakes for loss of attraction to someone you’re dating or married to are much higher than the stakes for loss of attraction to people you are not dating or married to. In this way, SO-OCD for bi+ people can often overlap with Relationship OCD, with OCD latching on to dissatisfaction with a partner and turning it into doubts about sexuality.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,152,7
4504,"4. Even without the impact of biphobia, the fluid nature of bisexuality can be an easy target for SO-OCD. The bi+ community often talks about something called the “bi-cycle”, which is a natural and very common shift of preferences within bisexuality over time. SO-OCD can latch onto this shifting of preferences (say, being more attracted to women for a while) and try and convince you it’s big, scary, and permanent. And because your preferences are indeed in flux, it can find lots of evidence to back that up. That does not mean it is right.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,95,7
4505,"5. Being bi+ can make it feel like none of the resources on SO-OCD are relevant to you. When everything you read is focused on monosexuals, it’s easy for OCD to convince you that your situation is different. SO-OCD about bisexuality can also be missed in clinical screening, where the questions tend to be gay/straight focused. And even when SO-OCD resources do acknowledge bisexuality, they often focus on being scared that you might be something you’re not, when SO-OCD (for everyone, but especially bi+ people) can also often look like “I don’t care what my sexuality is, I just need to know for sure.”",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,104,6
4506,"6. Despite all that, it’s really important to remember that the approach remains the same. It can be easy for OCD to tell you that because the resources don’t perfectly describe your situation, the advice doesn’t apply to you. But it does. No matter how you identify, your goal in ERP for SO-OCD is always to sit with the uncertainty that you don’t know what your sexuality is right now, and resist the urge to figure it out.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,78,6
4507,"7. A therapist can help you build tailored ERP exercises based on your unique experiences, feared outcomes, triggers, obsessions, and compulsions. ERP exercises  for people whose SO-OCD revolves around bisexuality (whether they fear they might be bi+, or they might not be bi+) might involve scenarios like: ",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,47,3
4508,"The deeper target of these exposures is not necessarily the possibility of having any particular sexual orientation. Rather, it is the possibility of not knowing one’s sexual identity—of not knowing one’s self—which is most often at the core of one’s fears. In general, every subtype of OCD boils down to the two hallmarks of OCD: refusal to allow any discomfort, and refusal to allow any uncertainty.",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,66,4
4509,"If you’re bi+, odds are high you’ve already struggled as a result of your sexuality in one way or another (due to internalized/externalized biphobia, bi erasure, adverse health outcomes due to discrimination, etc.) Having SO-OCD on top of all that can feel like adding insult to injury. But even though it can seem really different, challenging this form of OCD is exactly the same as challenging any other form of OCD. ",p,,/blog/bisexuality-so-ocd-the-invisible-so-ocd,71,4
4510,"Allow yourself to sit in the uncertainty of your sexuality, and resist that sense of urgency to “figure it all out.” Finding a bi+ positive therapist can make a big difference, and bi+ positive OCD support groups can make a big difference too. If the people who are meant to be helping you with this are biphobic, you have the right to find better people, and keep fighting. At the end of the day, the beauty of bisexuality—and all non-monosexual sexualities—is its expansiveness and fluidity.

That meant being everything I was not: neat, quiet, conscientious, and ingratiating. I always started on Monday morning, because that was the “right” time to do it. Of course, my attempts at being an entirely different person never lasted long. My real personality would reassert itself, and I’d beat myself up for it all week, until Monday came and the cycle started over again. ",p,When being “perfect” means “not being you”,/blog/my-journey-from-self-hating-perfectionist-to-autistic-ocd-advocate,93,7
4517,"It’s not surprising that my OCD focused so much on seeking approval and meeting unrealistic expectations. As a gifted child, the expectations placed on me were so terrifyingly high that imperfection never felt like an option. On top of that, I was diagnosed as autistic when I was 7. Unfortunately, the main “treatment” for autistic children to this day consists of punishing them for being their natural autistic selves, while rewarding them for masking (pretending to be neurotypical at the expense of their mental health). ",p,When being “perfect” means “not being you”,/blog/my-journey-from-self-hating-perfectionist-to-autistic-ocd-advocate,85,5
4518,"I grew up being forcibly taught that being myself was bad, so it makes sense that my OCD revolved around trying to be perfect, and that my idea of being perfect equaled being anybody but me.  It didn’t help that nobody told me I was autistic, leaving me to conclude for much of my life that I was just somehow inherently wrong.

4519,"And so I grew up having compulsions rewarded, like my “start being perfect” game, because they helped me pretend to be the person everyone wanted me to be. But being praised (or avoiding punishment) for this only made my OCD worse. I started picturing imaginary people watching and judging me 24/7, and I obsessively tried to act in ways I thought would gain their approval. After a while, I couldn’t switch them off, and the pressure to be perfect was constant, even when I was alone. ",p,When being “perfect” means “not being you”,/blog/my-journey-from-self-hating-perfectionist-to-autistic-ocd-advocate,86,5

4539,The Rumination Trap,h1,title,/blog/the-rumination-trap,3,1
4540,"One of the questions I get asked most by people starting OCD treatment is “how do I stop ruminating?” The answer seems straightforward enough: you can make a choice to stop. In reality, learning to stop ruminating is one of the most difficult things a person with OCD will do. It’s one thing to know something must be done and another to do something. This is a tremendous burden people with OCD often face. ",p,,/blog/the-rumination-trap,74,5
4541,What is rumination?,h2,What is rumination?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,3,1
4542,"Rumination occurs when you have constant and repetitive thoughts about something; it may involve making repeated attempts to solve a perceived problem you’re having. When you ruminate, you are directing a lot of your attention to a particular thought. It’s the difference between having a thought which can go away as quickly as it appeared, and being actively focused on a thought that you’re fixated on and that may be interfering with daily functioning. ",p,What is rumination?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,74,4
4543,"Rumination is a mental compulsion. For people struggling with OCD, rumination can look like engaging with an intrusive thought in an effort to figure it out. It can involve searching for an answer – specifically, needing to feel certain about it. You attempt to make sense of the intrusive thought or try to rationalize it. It may even look like trying to reverse the thought or move on from it with a feeling of assurance or peace. I would describe it as going down a rabbit hole, or being caught up in an endless loop. ",p,What is rumination?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,95,7
4544,"Mental compulsions are often overlooked because they are internal and unseen. They can be sneaky, and often the person with OCD doesn’t even realize that what they’re doing is a compulsion. Yet mental compulsions, after all, do what any other compulsion does: they reinforce the idea that an intrusive thought is dangerous, and deceive your brain into believing that it controls the outcome of the thought. ",p,What is rumination?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,66,4
4545,"One member I worked with would have the repeated intrusive thought that his partner would become ill if he didn’t properly prepare their food. In an effort to feel less anxious about this and to convince himself that his partner would not become ill, he would replay in his mind every step he had taken to prepare the food. He would picture it in his mind and walk through it repeatedly. He would do this several times until he felt convinced that he had taken the proper precautions. Some days, this could take hours, but he could not move forward with his day until he felt that this had been resolved. ",p,What is rumination?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,111,6
4546,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,h2,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,6,1
4547,"OCD is called the “doubting disorder” for many reasons: people with this illness often doubt their memories, the meaning of their thoughts, their values, etc. OCD distorts how they see things and the experiences they have. OCD often leaves them feeling unsure and forces them to seek comfort or reassurance. ",p,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,50,4
4548,"The nature of OCD makes it easy for a person to ruminate and to focus on justifying what they’re doing. After all, many people ruminate on problems they think they’re having in an attempt to solve them. The issue here is that with OCD, there is not necessarily any real problem or danger. Choosing to ruminate only strengthens the false alarm system OCD creates. ",p,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,64,5
4549,"As with any compulsion, the more you do it, the more the alarm continues to go off. You are inadvertently teaching your brain that in order to feel less anxious and uncomfortable, you need to take action. The truth is that you do not need to do anything to feel less anxious. Eventually anxiety fades. ",p,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,55,5
4550,"Even more pleasant emotions, such as joy, fade on their own. There’s nothing you have to do to stop feeling those emotions; the feeling simply moves on after a while. When something is funny, you don’t laugh forever – eventually you stop, without having to do anything. ",p,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,47,4
4551,"But when feelings of discomfort occur for people with OCD, the brain can send off a signal that there is a danger when there is not. This signal tends to create a high level of intolerance for feeling uncomfortable and causes people with OCD to try to avoid this feeling as much as possible. In order to overcome this, your brain must relearn the signals, which can occur through habituation. ",p,Why do people with OCD ruminate?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,70,4
4552,What is habituation?,h2,What is habituation?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,3,1
4553,"Habituation occurs when a person stops responding or paying attention to a stimulus – such as a thought, object, place, person or action – with repeated exposure to that stimulus. This essentially means getting used to something that you don’t like or that doesn’t feel comfortable. ",p,What is habituation?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,46,3
4554,"A personal example of habituation is that I grew up with a train track in my backyard. The train would always go over the tracks around 1am each day and would shake the entire house, that’s how close it was. Though I was acutely aware of it at first, after living there for a few weeks, I no longer paid attention to it. It didn’t wake me up in the middle of the night or cause me to get scared. I habituated and adjusted to it. I no longer noticed it or was bothered by it. The more I experienced it and saw that it was not dangerous, and that nothing bad happened, the less I even thought about it. I eventually stopped thinking about it altogether. ",p,What is habituation?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,127,9
4555,"The same is true for feared stimuli: the more someone is exposed to them, the more comfortable they become with them, and the less of a response they have to them. They began to build a tolerance to the thing that was once very distressing.  ",p,What is habituation?,/blog/the-rumination-trap,45,3
4556,"Addressing rumination, since it’s a mental compulsion, works in the same manner. Once you stop ruminating or engaging with the thought, the “false alarm” goes off less and less. The more you do this, the more it becomes habitual. Initially you may find yourself starting to ruminate and catch it. It’s important in these moments that you give yourself compassion and try again.

4562,"During a time when society has never had a greater need for high-quality mental healthcare services, some virtual behavioral health companies have garnered a negative reputation for being clinically ineffective, adopting a “growth-at-all-costs” mindset, and lacking transparency. The problem was recently highlighted by John Oliver, the popular Last Week Tonight host, who shared his unfiltered take on the US mental health crisis, as well as the boom of teletherapy, telepsychiatry, and mental healthcare apps. He communicated his frustration during the HBO segment, specifically noting: “There is nothing inherently wrong with teletherapy… In theory, teletherapy can help fill in some of the very real gaps in access, but the reality of these services has often been deeply underwhelming.”   ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,117,4
4563,"As the Cofounder and CEO of NOCD and a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a serious mental illness (SMI) that is widely misunderstood and affects 2.3% of the population, I can personally understand Mr. Oliver’s dissatisfaction with the US mental healthcare system. Often, Americans who need high-quality services for mental health issues the most are not able to get them. A shortage of licensed mental health professionals is certainly fueling the crisis, but what is most to blame—yet rarely specified—is the healthcare system’s failure to properly channel people with the most severe psychiatric conditions to specialists who are qualified to treat the root cause of their suffering. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,107,6
4564,"The problem has occurred due to two systematic gaps. The first is diagnostic: many licensed mental health professionals do not properly offer evidence-based diagnostic assessments at the start of care. This causes people with severe behavioral health issues to get misdiagnosed based on the symptoms of their suffering, rather than the root cause, and then mistreated by providers who lack the specialty training needed to effectively help them. Imagine suffering with a severe heart condition, getting misdiagnosed due to pain in your arm from it, and then being referred to a hand specialist for treatment. The situation could be life-threatening. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,100,6
4565,"This leads to the second systematic gap. Imagine if hand specialists purposely solicited vulnerable people with severe heart issues by running marketing campaigns online for “life-changing care,” knowing they lack the specialty training needed to treat them. It would be dangerous, irresponsible, and likely illegal. It’s shocking that similar unethical practices have been regularly occurring within the behavioral health system for decades without repercussions. This is a problem I have experienced firsthand.",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,72,6
4566,"When I finally discovered that the suffering I was experiencing had a name—OCD—I turned to Google to find a therapist near me who could treat OCD. I searched “OCD specialists in my area” and discovered a large list of providers on various websites, each one of whom claimed they could effectively treat OCD, among dozens of other conditions. When I investigated further, I’d estimate that less than 10% of the providers who were marketing to me actually had specialty training in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, the evidence-based behavioral therapy for OCD. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,93,4
4567,"Let’s think about that for a second. I was severely depressed at the time, a common occurrence for people with OCD and other SMIs. In fact, research suggests people with OCD are ten times more likely to die by suicide than the general population when they’re untreated. Despite my severity and risk level, many of the providers marketing to me were offering “talk therapy” services, which are proven to be ineffective for people with OCD, and can actually be harmful. If I hadn’t found an article from the International OCD Foundation that educated me about the questions to ask licensed mental health professionals before seeking help, I might have gotten worse, and the results could have been catastrophic. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,118,6
4568,"The boom of virtual behavioral health solutions over the past three years has only exacerbated the problem. Many companies under pressure from their investors to scale rapidly have taken the same “shortcut-to-growth” approach as the group practices that predated them. They have specifically failed to comprehensively diagnose people, and they have inaccurately marketed themselves as “one-stop-shops” for treatment, because there are no clear regulations in place against it. The only difference between many virtual behavioral health companies today and behavioral health providers of the past is the aggressiveness of their marketing towards at-risk populations that they do not have the training to treat. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,103,5
4569,"Society has been susceptible to these overly-aggressive campaigns, due to the widespread perception of mental health issues and treatments as homogeneous, a result of lingering stigma and a lack of education surrounding the complexity of the mental healthcare crisis. Companies with sleek brands promise hope, and millions of Americans want to believe that they can deliver. However, their lack of specialization often leaves at-risk people who muster the strength and courage to start their treatment not only with a terrible experience that makes them worse, but also with a deep sense of distrust in future treatments that potentially could transform their lives. Sadly, we are only beginning to see the devastating consequences of these unethical campaigns. ",p,,/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-virtual-behavioral-healthcare-is-here-to-stay-but-change-is-needed,116,5

4582,"When starting a healthcare company, do not underestimate the complexity of managing the revenue cycle. About 15% of our poor member reviews are from challenges surrounding our billing processes. In hindsight, a mistake we made was not investing enough resources into our billing infrastructure while we were trying to keep up with high member demand in 2020 and 2021. As a result, our revenue cycle processes became backed up and did not deliver timely invoices to our members.

4597,"Having intrusive thoughts and doing compulsions throughout one’s day can undoubtedly lead to feelings of sadness and often hopelessness. The old adage of which came first, the chicken or the egg, comes to mind. OCD can certainly impact the way that someone functions and lives their life. OCD can cause an individual to become so anxious that going out or doing things that they may have previously found enjoyable becomes unbearable. This can lead to depression. Oftentimes, mental health issues can be comorbid, meaning they exist together.",p,,/blog/can-erp-improve-symptoms-of-depression,87,7
4598,"If you have been diagnosed with both OCD and depression, the symptoms of depression may cause you to feel a sense of hopelessness and to feel overwhelmed by life’s challenges, which can impact therapy.

One of the things we know about people who are depressed is that they often feel like they are not “good enough” or that they are “failures.” ",p,,/blog/can-erp-improve-symptoms-of-depression,69,4
4599,"These core beliefs can impact them on a substantial level. If you believe this about yourself, it makes sense that this would trickle into every area of your life—including treatment. When you’re depressed, you may think “what’s the point in trying?” Or “I’ll always feel this way.” These thought patterns can be persistent and often can lead to a person not feeling competent enough to make the necessary changes in their life. ",p,,/blog/can-erp-improve-symptoms-of-depression,72,5

In exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, the gold standard OCD treatment, we teach you that even though you feel a certain way this doesn’t mean you cannot still act a different way. An example would be maybe you felt really anxious about going to a social event because you are worried about having intrusive thoughts. Even though you felt anxious, perhaps you chose to go anyway and let yourself experience the discomfort. The more that you do activities like this, the more you are able to see that it is not dangerous and your anxiety will eventually reduce.

Change is hard for everyone, whether they have OCD and depression, or not. ",p,Feelings catch up to actions,/blog/can-erp-improve-symptoms-of-depression,145,9
4603,"It’s important that someone suffering from OCD and depression learn the impact of their behaviors on their feelings. Changing one can change the other. In many cases, the intense anxiety from intrusive thoughts or the lost hours and missed opportunities from compulsions can cause or contribute to symptoms of depression.

4651,"Any behavior that engages with the obsession– e.g. asking for reassurance, avoidance, rumination– reinforces it. By preventing these behaviors, ERP teaches people that they can tolerate their distress without turning to compulsions. It thereby drains obsessions of their power.

4656,"Is it strange to think that you could treat a psychiatric condition by doing things like telling yourself over and over that you might lose control and become a pedophile? Yes, and it’s not the kind of thing most of us would like to spend our time doing. But let’s say you’re so bothered by one fleeting thought like “I might be attracted to my 3-year-old nephew” that it makes you physically sick. You think all day about it, write mental lists of reasons you’re a good person, arrange your drive to work so you don’t pass any elementary schools or day care centers. But then the thought pops up when you see a toddler on a billboard, or when a coworker brings their kid in one day. You stop going to visit your sister and nephew, coming up with different excuses every time they ask. The thoughts torture you, and it seems like your whole life revolves around avoiding any thought about how you might have been attracted to a kid.",p,Isn’t ERP kind of messed up?,/blog/what-is-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,172,7
4657,"This is the kind of stuff that gets people into ERP. It’s not really about someone who has one quick thought about pedophilia– we all have thoughts we’d rather not have. Rather, this is a form of treatment for people whose lives are stuck because of their thoughts. That’s why patients are willing to push through the pain and strangeness, and why clinicians are willing to temporarily make the pain worse so things can get better.",p,Isn’t ERP kind of messed up?,/blog/what-is-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,76,5
4658,"In ERP a fair amount of distress in inescapable, and that’s an unfortunate fact.

4659,"ERP is about shorter-term pain for long-term gain. But it has to be done carefully, with an experienced clinician you respect and trust. It’s good to weigh the pros and cons beforehand: What do you value, and how can ERP help you get there? What are your goals? And what are your limits for the amount of distress you’re prepared to go through? How long do you want to be in treatment? How’s your support system outside of therapy?

4660,"An important note here: pedophiles are viewed in our society as some of the worst people imaginable, and this shame undoubtedly weighs on people anguishing over their thoughts. But the key separator between a pedophile and someone whose OCD centers around pedophilia is that someone with what therapists call “pedophilia OCD” doesn’t enjoy those thoughts. In fact, they can become the bane of their existence. A pedophile may feel shame too, and may not be without remorse, but probably won’t experience these thoughts as contrary to their values or who they really are. For both people with OCD and the rest of us, it’s important to understand the differences between thinking about something and wanting to do it.",p,Isn’t ERP kind of messed up?,/blog/what-is-exposure-and-response-prevention-therapy,118,6
4661,"Another important note: although pedophilia obsessions seem like an extreme case, they’re not. OCD takes all kinds of disturbing and difficult forms. Further, there’s no evidence that someone with more typically “disturbing” obsessions (e.g. pedophilia, harming other people) suffers more than another person with something that would seem more trivial to others.

4788,False Memory OCD Symptoms,h2,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,4,1
4789,"False Memory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an OCD subtype characterized by ongoing intrusive doubting thoughts and compulsive behavior around a past event. People with False Memory OCD experience frequent doubts about things that have happened to them and may be convinced they’ve done something wrong despite no evidence of these memories being true (e.g., “Did I accidentally steal and don’t remember?”). The recurrent doubting thoughts are often viewed as an indication that their fears are true (e.g., “if I’m so concerned I stole, then I must have. Otherwise, why am I thinking about it?”), which fuels anxiety about their memories and drives people struggling with these thoughts to engage in various compulsions aimed at gaining certainty about their memories (e.g., asking for continual reassurance from a friend about whether you accidentally stole something, or searching through your home for the receipt). ",p,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,141,11
4790,"Most people with False Memory OCD find their doubting obsessions can feel impossible to let go of. Their false memories can feel like real events. The more the person fixates on them, the more their brain may fill in these false memories with even more false information, further convincing themselves they are guilty of things they haven’t done. Furthermore, even though behaviors aimed at feeling more certain of one’s memory (e.g., repeated checking) might seem to increase confidence in memory accuracy, research actually shows the opposite: these behaviors actually ",,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,89,6

4792,"Alcohol use can play a significant role in False Memory OCD. When a person can’t clearly remember what happened for long periods of time, their OCD may take over and start spinning tales of false memories. ",p,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,36,3
4793,"Let’s say Joe is in a committed relationship. He was drinking one night and can’t exactly remember everything that happened at the bar with his friend. He has a hazy memory of a brief interaction with a woman. He might begin to fixate on this specific interaction and wonder: “Did anything else besides a brief conversation take place between us? Did I cheat on my partner last night? How can I be certain?” Joe’s uncertainty and anxiety may feel overwhelming and drive him toward compulsive behaviors in order to alleviate it. This could look like asking his friend to recall what happened last night. Do they remember you interacting with anyone? Was it a normal interaction? Joe may also be compelled to find physical evidence, like asking the bar for last night’s video footage, just to be sure. These compulsions only ease the person’s anxiety temporarily. For someone with OCD, eventually, the anxieties start up again. (e.g., Joe might start thinking, “Yes, my friend told me he saw me interact with this woman, and we only exchanged a few words, but what if something happened when he stepped outside?”)  ",p,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,189,11
4794,"In some cases, False Memory OCD can have devastating consequences for a person’s life. A person could be convinced that they committed a terrible act, even if there’s no evidence to prove this. Out of shame, they could isolate themselves from others, convinced they are a bad person. In more extreme cases, people with False Memory OCD have been convinced they’ve committed a crime like murder and will confess because they believe they are guilty and should face punishment. ",p,False Memory OCD Symptoms,/blog/false-memory-ocd,79,5

4797,"A common False Memory OCD compulsion is to mentally review past experiences to try and prove or disprove your doubts about what happened. So if your obsessive thought is that you walked out of a restaurant without paying, you might try and review every single moment of that experience in your head. You’ll try to mentally replay when exactly the waiter came over, and the moment you asked for the bill. You might try to remember whether you paid with cash or a credit card.

4798,"Reassurance seeking: People with False Memory OCD might turn to friends or other people who witnessed the memory in question in an effort to validate the information they are doubting. In this example, the person might call the restaurant to be sure they paid. They may ask the friend they were with or go back in person to confirm their bill was paid with the waiter. The questions may be more general as well, like asking a friend or family member: Have you ever walked out of a restaurant without paying? Do you think that could possibly happen? ",p,False Memory OCD: Some Examples of Compulsive Behaviors,/blog/false-memory-ocd,98,4

4800,"Confessing: When someone with False Memory OCD has convinced themselves they are guilty of an action that happened in the past, they may confess to important figures in their life, or to authority figures on what they’ve done wrong. For example, a person may see a news report of a murder and become convinced they were the ones to do it on the basis that they cannot exactly remember what they were doing when the murder took place but recall being in the vicinity. They may turn themselves in on the basis that they think they may potentially be guilty, even though there is no evidence at all that they had done this. ",p,False Memory OCD: Some Examples of Compulsive Behaviors,/blog/false-memory-ocd,113,4

4802,"Self-punishment or Avoidance: Someone may act on the guilt from what they may have done in an effort to ease their anxiety.

4803,"Even though everyone might have doubts about what they’ve done in the past or worry that they may have forgotten to pay at a restaurant at one point or another, these thoughts usually leave a person’s mind without much difficulty. That’s unfortunately not the case for someone with False Memory OCD. The fear of false memories does not go away once the person with OCD has gotten reasonable evidence they are innocent. Instead, their brain starts spinning further possibilities of uncertainty, creating new scenarios that start the obsessive-compulsive cycle over again. One criterion for a diagnosis of False Memory OCD is that a person spends at least one hour per day on these obsessions and compulsions. Often, the obsessions and compulsions can take control of a person and their ability to function in their everyday life. ",p,False Memory OCD: Some Examples of Compulsive Behaviors,/blog/false-memory-ocd,136,7

ERP is considered the gold standard for OCD treatment and has been found 80% effective. The majority of patients experience results within 12 – 25 sessions. As part of ERP therapy, you’d be tracking your obsessions and compulsions around your false memory and making a list of how distressing each thought is. You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions.

A therapist may work with you to eventually face your fear and dine at this restaurant again. This may take time, especially if this exposure feels overwhelming and touches on one of your biggest fears (public humiliation). Together with your therapist, you’ll work to rank different exposures by difficulty. A less stressful exposure in this scenario might be to repeat to yourself, “I may or may not have walked out of this restaurant without paying. It’s impossible to know for sure.” ERP therapy aims to acquaint you with uncertainty and become more comfortable with it so that the anxiety of the unknown no longer feels as terrifying or unmanageable. ",p,Example of False Memory OCD Exposures ,/blog/false-memory-ocd,141,8

Instead of calling friends or trying to verify a particular event by researching news reports, a therapist might have you describe this memory as if it actually happened, walk through the worst-case scenario, and what this might mean for your life.

4815,Note: This post contains discussions of pedophilia and a form of OCD that causes people to fear that they may be a pedophile.

4816,"Intrusive thoughts happen to nearly everyone. Every once in a while, most of us find our minds wandering off very suddenly into uncomfortable territory. These intrusive thoughts can even make us question ourselves. That discomfort is no stranger to those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For those with OCD, intrusive thoughts are frequently recurring and cause substantial distress, leading to compulsions in an effort to try to quell the discomfort. ",p,,/blog/pocd-arousal-not-sign-real-desire,69,6
4817,"These thoughts can be particularly unsettling for people with various subtypes of OCD. Pedophilia OCD, or POCD, is no exception to this. In fact, it can be one of the most uncomfortable subtypes of OCD to discuss. Research suggests that although POCD is fairly common among people with OCD, it goes largely unnoticed and misdiagnosed in most patients because the shame surrounding POCD thoughts is so strong, they don’t want to tell even a therapist. ",p,,/blog/pocd-arousal-not-sign-real-desire,75,5

4821,"While pedophilia itself is defined as sexual attraction to children, pedophilia OCD or POCD is a subtype of OCD that causes fears or worries that one might be a pedophile. It often involves intrusive, sexual thoughts around prepubescent children. The important distinction between pedophilia and POCD is that sexual thoughts of this nature are, by definition, enjoyable to pedophiles, while those with POCD find these thoughts extremely uncomfortable. ",p,What is POCD?,/blog/pocd-arousal-not-sign-real-desire,68,4
4822,"Occasionally with POCD, these intrusive thoughts can cause physical arousal, also known as ‘groinal response’, and this can be incredibly unsettling for those dealing with POCD. Research has shown that arousal comes in all shapes and forms and, in most cases, physical arousal is not at all linked to our values and beliefs but simply triggered by sexual relevance.

Typically, the brain sends these messages before true values and preferences can be taken into consideration. ",p,POCD arousal: a biological response,/blog/pocd-arousal-not-sign-real-desire,69,5

A form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), ERP has been proven in studies to be incredibly effective in treating OCD, making it the first and best choice for anyone living with OCD or POCD. ERP works in a very simple way by exposing those with OCD to potentially triggering thoughts or situations to work on preventing compulsive responses to their obsessions in a safe and controlled environment. Through ERP, one works on tolerating uncertainty and reducing compulsions such as reassurance seeking. Over time and with repeated practice, ERP can help those with OCD end the obsessive-compulsive cycle and regain freedom over their thoughts and actions. ",p,How is POCD treated? ,/blog/pocd-arousal-not-sign-real-desire,123,6

4873,"Tapping/touching movements: With this condition, some people will report an urge to do some form of movement when faced with an intrusive thought, image, or urge. Typically there is no logical explanation or connection between the thought and the behavior, but the person is compelled to perform the action to relieve the distress caused by the obsession. People with tapping or touching compulsions might report tapping household items a certain number of times before being able to continue with their daily activities. Some report having to walk through doorways a certain amount of times, sometimes just until it feels “right.” For others, it can be turning on lights, using remote controls, picking items up, or putting clothing on—the list can go on. There might be an urge to do something repeatedly until it “feels okay” to move on. It is often described as being stuck; one must complete this to either neutralize the obsession or move forward.

They often have a very hard time trusting their own ability to “know” something. This can lead to excessive reassurance-seeking. Although this can take on many facets, some common examples include a person with OCD asking whether they’ve lied, sinned, offended someone, or touched something that they deem unclean.

4883,"Thought Replacing: This serves to replace “bad” thoughts, urges, and images with “good” ones. Another way to look at this is that the person with OCD is seeking to neutralize an obsession that they feel is inappropriate. This mental activity is not seen by others, but it serves as an action used by the individual to feel better and to relieve their distress, thus making it a compulsion. This may also look like saying particular phrases, prayers, or mantras in one’s head in an attempt to cancel out the obsessions. ",p,Silently engaging in compulsive behaviors through mental compulsions,/blog/mental-compulsions-the-unseen-battle,90,5
4884,"Rumination: This is not just about trying to solve a real-life problem; think of this as overanalyzing or trying to solve a perceived problem. Most often people with OCD explain that they just need to think about something until they can “figure it out.” They may say things like “I just need to know” or “I need to think on it until I have some peace.” What they are actually saying is that they have dwelled on a topic—often for days, but sometimes even years—all in an effort to “feel” okay. A large part of OCD treatment is learning that you don’t need to always “feel” okay. In fact, it is impossible to always “feel” okay. We must teach ourselves that we can sit in discomfort, and we can tolerate anxiety. As much as we don’t like the emotion of anxiety, it is just another emotion, and it will eventually pass on its own. One of the lies OCD often tells us is that we must “do” something to get rid of unpleasant feelings—the truth is we don’t need to “do” anything. It goes away and we learn we can handle it. ",p,Silently engaging in compulsive behaviors through mental compulsions,/blog/mental-compulsions-the-unseen-battle,192,11

4887,Distraction: This may be purposefully thinking about one thing in an attempt to not think about another.

On the other hand, when you prevent yourself from engaging in your compulsions, you teach yourself a new way to respond and will very likely experience a noticeable reduction in your anxiety. As part of ERP therapy, you will track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of how distressing each thought is.

ERP specifically focuses on targeting the obsessions and compulsions the patient is experiencing. During treatment, a patient works with a therapist to slowly expose themselves to the source of their obsession — without performing a compulsive action.

4968,"Getting children and teens to actively practice Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) and to stop doing rituals can be challenging. If you face this challenge, there are basically two types of consequences to give. ",p,,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,34,3
4969,"Positive consequences can reinforce a desired behavior and are best to try first.  Example:  If a child does his homework every day, he can earn an extra hour of screen time.  Negative consequences teach a child to make a good choice.  Example:  If homework isn’t done, then you lose your phone for a day.   Consequences work well when children realize that they have more to gain by eliminating the negative behavior (such as a compulsion, avoidance, or seeking reassurance).   Children also respond well to behavior charts, earning stickers or extra privileges for good behavior.",p,,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,94,7

4971,"1.        The consequence of losing a privilege has to be of great importance to the child to be effective.  It has to be something they truly want and desire so that they learn to make a better choice.  Take time to find out what your child or teen really treasures (phone time, video games, shopping, time with friends, a specific meal, “movie night,” etc.).  Asking them what they think a good consequence would be can be helpful and often surprising!",,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,80,6
4972,"2.       Consequences should be immediate, and, the younger the child, the more immediate.  Example:  A young child will respond to smaller, more frequent rewards such as earning a sticker for each session of ERP.  Stickers can accumulate to a larger reward.  Consequences should also be natural.  For example, if the child is playing with a toy and doesn’t follow directions, they lose the toy for a short amount of time. For a teen, it might be harder to pick the consequence immediately. It is okay to take time to think about what would be the best consequence. This gives you time to consult with significant others if needed.",p,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,108,10
4973,"3.  Parents must be consistent in delivering consequences and reinforcement. When parents say consequences are not working, I often ask about consistency.  Children are most likely to continue an unhealthy or unwanted  behavior when they learn that parents might give in or forget to follow through with a specific consequence.  This can be hard due to the fact that when they are delivering consequences, parents are impacted as well.  Example:  Parents who shut off the WiFi for a day after their child did not follow through with their ERP homework or clear instructions on response prevention will also miss out themselves. Parents might be impacted on an emotional level, too. Simply put, it can be distressing to parents to witness their child struggle with anxiety or an angry outburst as the child is trying to resist engaging in a ritual–and that can make it even more challenging for the parent to remain consistent with following through with consequences. This is why it is so important for families to remember that resisting urges to engage in compulsions is the key to overcoming OCD, even if numerous people within the family are experiencing heightened emotions as they go through the process of ERP.",p,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,201,10
4974,"4.  The degree or size of the consequence is important to consider.  If a child doesn’t comply, the consequence should be in proportion to the violation.  Example:  If a child doesn’t engage in homework, they don’t earn a sticker toward a reward or lose phone privileges for the day.   If the consequence was to lose the phone for a month, the child may feel frustrated and lose hope. It is also key that all significant others work as a team in decision making around delivering consequences.",p,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,86,7
4975,"5.   Finally, vary the consequences.  If you are only always taking away the phone, the child/teen might not care after a while. Mix it up.",,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,25,5
4976,"Remember the following:  How can we help this child improve?  What do they need to understand?  Do they need to learn healthy skills?   Be calm and consistent and explain why the consequence is happening.  Explain your rules and what you expect.  You can also have a system of earning back time for positive behavior, or if they can role play a more constructive way to manage an ERP exercise after one has not gone well.  If the above factors are present, chances are you will have a good system of delivering consequences and changing your child’s compulsive behaviors!",p,Consider these tips for how to give consequences that will work!,/blog/how-to-find-consequences-that-work,98,4

4998,"Few conditions cause people to feel more isolated, misunderstood, and debilitated than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). That’s why OCD has been consistently ranked by the World Health Organization as a top 10 cause of disability, and why people with it often develop severe comorbidities like substance use disorders (SUDs) after going untreated for some time. In fact, a study found that between 25-40% of people with OCD suffer with substance use disorders, and 70% of people develop their substance use disorder after their OCD symptoms onset. ",p,,/blog/heres-what-to-do-when-ocd-strikes-unexpectedly,85,4
4999,"The condition’s chronic nature plays a big role in the turmoil it causes. Episodes strike unexpectedly, and when they occur, they hit like a ton of bricks. Over time, the frequency and severity of unexpected episodes cause people with OCD to do things such as self-medicate and avoid leaving their home – seemingly their only plausible solutions to end the pain. As a result, many people with OCD have a very difficult time holding down a job, attending school, or even engaging in common social activities. ",p,,/blog/heres-what-to-do-when-ocd-strikes-unexpectedly,86,5

It’s an incredibly liberating feeling to not have to walk on eggshells from morning to evening, just to avoid getting triggered and sent into a cycle of distress. ",p,,/blog/heres-what-to-do-when-ocd-strikes-unexpectedly,39,3
5001,Experiencing this level of transformation starts with seeing a licensed therapist that is trained in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) – the evidence-based therapy for OCD that teaches people to extinguish compulsive behaviors – and it ends with learning how to effectively self-manage through OCD episodes when on one’s own. ,p,,/blog/heres-what-to-do-when-ocd-strikes-unexpectedly,50,2
5002,"Learning how to manage OCD while alone is probably the most important aspect of treatment.

Even if you see none, you might rush immediately to the bathroom and wash your entire arm for 5 minutes. Others in the bathroom may be looking at you as if there might be something wrong, but you’d ignore them, because you are dealing with a bigger concern at the moment.

5044,3 Tips For Managing OCD As a Professional,h1,title,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,8,1
5045,"One of the hardest parts about living with OCD is having to manage it at work. Imagine showing up to your office in the morning, dressed nicely, and opening up your laptop to a slew of emails. However, unlike your colleagues sitting near you, the more you sift through your inbox, the more your mind wanders and begins to reflect on the feelings that you had a minute earlier while walking past your coworker. The thoughts begin to rage: Did you make eye contact with her and smile? If you didn’t make enough eye contact with her, will your coworker get into a horrific car accident on the way home from the office? ",p,,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,113,4
5046,"You may know the fears are irrational—how could looking at your coworker prevent something terrible from happening to her? Yet, despite the fear’s illogical nature, it feels real enough to begin doing mental jujitsu. The more you tell yourself, “that’s absurd,” the more the fear finds loopholes in your logic and casts doubt on your ability to disprove it completely. You feel like an airline pilot flying without a barometer, unable to determine the sky from the ground. ",p,,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,78,4
5047,"While the chaos is running rampant in your brain, you realize that the first meeting of the day is about to start. To keep producing for your job, you must find a way to “snap out of it” and participate in a conference call with your largest customer. It doesn’t go completely according to plan: Instead of listening to your customer’s needs and preparing to answer their questions, you spend the entire time in your own head, trying to logically disprove your magical thinking-related fears to “save” your coworker. As a result, you give very poor responses to your customer’s questions, causing them to leave the call feeling frustrated. ",p,,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,109,5
5048,"Your OCD has sparked a new set of fires at work, but despite the challenges, you’re not able to address them with urgency. The reason: the stress from your professional issues pales in comparison to the distress you are feeling from OCD. The condition has paralyzed you from feeling any other emotion in life. Weeks later, because of your performance at work with your largest customer, your boss puts you on a performance improvement plan and your job is now at-risk. ",p,,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,81,5

5053,"Invest in finding a great therapist with specialty training in OCD and ERP. The benefit of doing this first is that research shows it’s the fastest way to manage your OCD symptoms. With untreated OCD, it will be nearly impossible to do anything else. You will likely be in OCD’s grip throughout each day, trying to keep your head above water. ",p,Invest in Your Health First,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,61,5

Still, it’s critical to work with a licensed therapist who specializes in OCD and ERP as a first step. There are other therapists trained in treating OCD with ERP on the IOCDF website and through Psychology Today; however, we recommend that you interview any prospective therapist before booking an appointment (even those at NOCD). ",p,Invest in Your Health First,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,73,4
5056,"Once you begin managing OCD and the condition is somewhat under control, it’s critical to build and maintain your personal foundation, since it makes you feel better throughout the day and can help you do “response prevention” more easily when OCD pops up unexpectedly. If your personal foundation weakens, life can feel harder, and you are more likely to experience burnout at work due to the stress outside of work. That feeling could lead to a relapse in OCD symptoms. You can strengthen your personal foundation by exercising daily, sleeping at least six hours per night, spending quality time with your family and loved ones, and eating a balanced diet filled with protein, vegetables, and fruit. ",p,Invest in Your Health First,/blog/3-tips-for-managing-ocd-as-a-professional,116,5

Additionally, once you’ve set your goal, you need a support network to hold you accountable to it, especially when you face short-term challenges. These should be people who are close enough to you to positively remind you of your goal when times get tough, and who know you well enough to offer you transparent feedback if it’s warranted.

When I need to see a doctor, I want to know that they are specialized in the issues I need care for, and not what their faith is. Even if a therapist does match your belief system, there is no guarantee that they approach that system in the same way that you do. I say all of this because OCD can use anything to try to convince you that therapy will not be helpful for you based on variables that do not have to actually interfere with therapy. ",p,What if my therapist does not share my faith – how will I be able to work with someone who has a different worldview?,/blog/can-a-therapist-that-doesnt-share-my-faith-treat-me-effectively,146,5

There is no right or wrong answer as to what a therapist chooses to disclose or not to disclose. And, while I have disclosed a lot about my life, I choose not to disclose my faith or belief system because I have seen how some members with scrupulosity OCD refused to work with a therapist/chaplain of a different faith, even when that therapist/chaplain was part of a multidisciplinary team at a residential treatment center I opened. ",p,Why don’t you share your faith view with your members?,/blog/can-a-therapist-that-doesnt-share-my-faith-treat-me-effectively,98,5

People with race OCD experience frequent intrusive thoughts about the idea that they may 1) be racist without their control, 2) behave in a racist way without their knowledge or 3) be perceived as racist. They experience frequent worry and guilt about what this might mean about them as a person (for example: “Did I accidentally offend this person on the phone? Does that mean I’m racist?”). The guilt, shame and anxiety drive people with race OCD to engage in various compulsions aimed to alleviate their distress (for example, asking a friend for ",,,/blog/what-is-race-ocd-overview-symptoms-treatment-options,117,4

However, with race OCD, the concern is never-ending, and these doubting thoughts can feel impossible to let go of despite extensive reassurance. Someone with this condition may have a thought come into their mind after a conversation with a stranger. They might begin thinking: “Did I say anything strange? Was I racist just now when I asked them about their day? What if I was racist?

ERP is considered the gold standard for OCD treatment and has been found effective for 80% of people with OCD. The majority of patients experience results within 12 to 25 sessions. As part of ERP therapy, you will track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of how distressing each thought is.

Maybe I’m not. It’s impossible to know for sure.” This teaches your brain a new thought pattern and begins to get you comfortable with the uncertainty fueling your obsessions and compulsions.

5190,"People with this subtype of OCD experience frequent, intrusive, unwanted thoughts that they could be responsible for something awful happening because they did not perform specific actions or because of something they did or didn’t do in the past. Though it’s called responsibility OCD, it’s caused by thoughts about having been irresponsible in some way. ",p,What Is Responsibility OCD?,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,55,3

5192,"People with responsibility OCD focus exclusively on the impact their actions or thoughts could have on others.” For example, they may be excessively worried about the possibility of running someone over. They might feel it is their job to be 100% responsible for making sure their loved ones are always safe. They may be overly concerned with saying something or doing something that could hurt someone physically or emotionally. They might even feel an excessive amount of responsibility for protecting our planet. The responsibility and feared outcomes are unique to each person with OCD because OCD always goes after what each person values the most.",p,Responsibility OCD Symptoms ,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,105,7
5193,"These intrusive thoughts can take over a person’s ability to think about anything else and lead to intense fears about the severity of their condition. In an attempt to stop these intrusive thoughts, people with responsibility OCD engage in compulsions.

5194,"People with responsibility OCD experience high levels of guilt, too. Their guilt could lead them to go out of their way to help others and prevent these imagined scenarios from becoming a reality. As a result, their actions are driven by a sense of guilt and fear of doing something wrong because they fear they are secretly a bad person and that others could be greatly harmed because they failed to prevent such a thing. ",p,Responsibility OCD Symptoms ,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,75,4

5201,"As part of ERP therapy, you’ll track your obsessions and compulsions and make a list of possible ways to face your fears. You’ll work with your therapist to slowly put yourself into situations that bring on your obsessions and the accompanying anxiety or discomfort while also working with you to prevent giving into compulsions. ERP exercises will be mindfully created so that you’re gradually building toward your goal rather than moving too quickly and getting overwhelmed. ",p,ERP Therapy for Responsibility OCD,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,76,4
5202,"The idea behind ERP therapy is that exposure to these thoughts and the discomfort while resisting compulsions is the most effective way to treat OCD. This is because while we can’t totally control our thoughts, we can control our behaviors. When you continually submit to the urge to do compulsions, it only strengthens your perceived need to engage in them.",p,ERP Therapy for Responsibility OCD,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,60,4

5206,"Let’s say that every night, you can’t stop seeing mental images of you and your family’s home going up in flames or being invaded by armed robbers. These scenes are vivid and horrific.

5207,"An ERP therapist may ask you to welcome the intrusive images without trying to make them go away or do any compulsions in response to them. You might think, “Welcome them? No way! That’s terrible. I just want these images to stop and for my family to be safe.” But instead of trying to suppress them, your therapist may ask you to put your full attention on them, again, without resorting to compulsions. ",p,Examples of Responsibility OCD Exposures,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,73,5
5208,"This teaches your brain a new response to your obsessions and the anxiety they bring. And it shows you that OCD doesn’t have to control your life and keep you from living the way you would like. Eventually, you will begin to distinguish yourself from your OCD, and it will be easier to let intrusive thoughts and images come and go without engaging in compulsions.",p,Examples of Responsibility OCD Exposures,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,65,4
5209,"As part of ERP treatment, you will be asked to gradually give up your checking routines at a gradual pace.

5210,"Once you become more familiar with intrusive thoughts and images and allow them to exist without responding via compulsions, they typically begin to feel less alarming. By confronting these thoughts without compulsions, you start to learn that your feared outcomes won’t occur, that you can manage the outcome if it does occur, and that you can tolerate the anxiety or distress that arises when you have intrusive thoughts. In some cases, people find that their anxiety subsides to the point where they no longer experience intense fears related to their thoughts.",p,Examples of Responsibility OCD Exposures,/blog/responsibility-ocd-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it,91,4

5219,"A gold standard treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is exposure and response prevention (ERP), a specialized therapy that has consistently demonstrated excellent outcomes in the treatment of OCD. ERP works by having people purposely face situations that provoke their obsessions, then helps them resist doing compulsions in response to the resulting anxiety. ",p,,/blog/how-frequently-should-i-do-erp-with-a-therapist,52,3
5220,"With OCD, a person’s compulsions only temporarily relieve discomfort and actually makes their anxiety worse in the long run. When people learn how to accept the distress caused by their obsessions, they can habituate–or experience a progressive decline in their distress–instead of attempting to neutralize that discomfort with compulsions. ",p,,/blog/how-frequently-should-i-do-erp-with-a-therapist,49,3

Specifically, when members meet with their therapist for 60-minute sessions twice each week for the first three weeks, we see the most significant reduction in OCD symptoms. Other research studies have also found that more frequent sessions are the most effective way of reducing symptoms. This effect is above and beyond the total number of sessions; in other words, for example, 12 sessions over 9 weeks is more powerful than 12 sessions over 12 weeks.",p,How frequently is treatment needed?
